Which will be (likely) be tackled in that order.

The goal of mine is to deploy for releng use by end of quarter, and iterate fast on filling in missing pieces.

What I expect to work by EOQ (checked items are ""works with this PR"")
- [x] Create a loan bug if one not specified
- [x] Create or reopen a tracking bug and link to loan bug
- [x] Select an inhouse machine if we don't preselect it. (using a dumb algorithm)
- [ ] Give us steps we manually need to select ""done"" on for manual parts, using links to wiki
- [x] crappy UI
- [ ] Releng able to manually enter ""current loans"" through UI.  (might actually be done, haven't tested lately)

Immediate next step for work after the above is all done and deployed is:
- [ ] Close out loan (currently just close bug, but might evolve to kill off AWS instance, file reimage bug, etc.)

- I replaced `gulp-express` with `gulp-live-server` because that was what `gulp-express` [recommends](https://github.com/gimm/gulp-express). 
- This showed me errors which allowed me to get the app running (needed a Firebase key)
- It also started the server! (Even after fixing the Firebase error, I couldn't get `gulp-express` to work again)

I can see why it fails but I wasn't getting why it passes when you run them all. Now I see it's because the Django request middleware gets set up by `ClientHandler`if you run the other test classes, and this is necessary to have a `request.user` for the csrf middleware to check for.

So strictly speaking it seems like `TestCsrfMiddleware` should also set up request middleware, at least for the failing method that needs `request.user`.

I have made a hack for this here, not sure if it's the best way. (or could I just set a dummy `user` attribute on the request and leave it at that?)

### Github Survey Data Analysis
https://github.com/avneet14027/Github-Survey-analysis/blob/master/SurveyAnalysis.md <br>
This is a contribution towards Diversity and Inclusion Issue - Visualization Of Github Data. The main goal is here to analyze various factors affecting an individuals contribution to open source. The entire analysis was done in R and is accessible in the form of a markdown file with all the plots included in it. Also, R code has been provided in a separate file within the same repository. Interesting observations came out from this data, the likeliness of men vs women and non binary genders , towards contributing to open source, being employed full time is enormous as compared to the other gender categories. Moreover, an analysis on the various types of contributions and participations have also been done. 
This was also a way for learning R for me through interesting data analysis. 
A variety of visualization techniques like grouped bar charts, simple bar chart, chord diagram, heat-maps etc. were explored for the same.

Programming Language: R
Tools: RStudio
The young people survey is a dataset released by Kaggle about hobbies, interests, certain demographic factors, educational qualification of todays youth, movie and music preferences, personal feelings, personal choices on life struggles, happiness index etc. The goal of this analysis is to ponder upon the nature of today's youth who are going to be leaders of tomorrow. Also, the reason I chose this dataset is to know the general trend among todays youth in terms of music and movie preferences and analyzing social quality of life based on personal factors and decisions. Also, this dataset gives us an insight into the gender gaps as well as gaps in urban and rural life within various aspects of life that need to be contemplated upon.

- Start using jyson as a drop-in replacement for the jython ""json"" module which performs horribly.
- Implement working reducers

This change has been tested against telemetry data on mango-gw and works.

Next steps:
- Implement the combiner
- Have TypeWritable implement RawComparator for extra speed
- Do some additional type checking in the python driver for better debugging before deployment
- Make the output serialization of tuples produce excel-tab CSV format
- Allow scripts to customize their output (already implemented in python driver, sorta)

- Implement ""TypeWritable"" which efficiently wraps python strings, ints, floats, and tuples of these.
- Start using jyson as a drop-in replacement for the jython ""json"" module which performs horribly.
- Implement working reducers
- Implement a final combiner which takes the input from multiple reducers and combines it into a single result file on the local machine.

This change has been tested against telemetry data on mango-gw and works.

Next steps:
- Implement the combiner
- Have TypeWritable implement RawComparator for extra speed
- Do some additional type checking in the python driver for better debugging before deployment
- Make the output serialization of tuples produce excel-tab CSV format
- Allow scripts to customize their output (already implemented in python driver, sorta)
- Change the dispatch mechanism to include all of ""scripts"" in the JAR file and select which script to run dynamically. Allow importing of utility modules i.e. ""combiner = pydoop.countcombine; reduce = pydoop.countreduce""

Fortunately there is a simple and equally functional alternative; if the monkeypatch is done in the root `urls.py` before the url patterns are declared, it will still take effect before views are imported. This pull request recommends that instead.

This pull request's main goal is to update freeze-dry from 0.2.0 to 0.2.4. freeze-dry 0.2.1 introduces postcss as a dependency, which rollup does not like due to a circular dependency postcss contains (see the linked issue in #34). A potential solution to this problem is using a rollup plugin that bundles postcss using webpack (eliminating the circular dependency) before rollup then bundles postcss up along with the rest of the codebase. The rollup plugin comes from the issue linked in #34 and [feels awkward](https://gist.github.com/tivac/d3dd0142e7c52d0d0a5a05b6686340e3). But it does work.

I updated the other dependencies before stumbling across this rollup plugin solution and had hoped simply updating them would solve the problem. It did not, but I have not gone back to see if the plugin solution works without updating the other dependencies. Since everything is working with the dependencies updated (though the syntax for the copy plugin needed to change), I think we should be okay with updating them. The naive assumption being that the dependencies are better in their newer versions.

freeze-dry 0.2.4 does bring immense performance increases (as I will post in #38).

Instead of copying the input contents and everything else from one form to another, just move the page elements around by twiddling CSS. This gets rid of half the HTML and JS on the index page and avoids us having to muck with selection ranges manually, which vary in API across browsers.

Also, switch from ""keyup"" event to ""input"". This makes editing the search terms without pressing keys (e.g., selecting Cut or Paste from a menu) works.

Redo much of the CSS:
* Get rid of overspecified selectors.
* Kill inline styling.

This pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point. I will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, **as soon as you merge this pull request**.

## ✅ If this pull request passes and everything is still working

This is really good news. Merge this pull request and I will keep you posted about dependency updates you shouldn’t miss.

## ❌ If this pull request fails and things aren’t working

**Note: I won’t start sending you further updates, unless you have merged this very pull request**.

So, how do we proceed? I suggest you find out what dependency update is causing the problem. Adapt your code so things are working nicely together again. [next-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update) is a really handy tool to help you with this.

Push the changes to this branch and merge it.

In case you can not, or do not want to update a certain dependency right now, you can of course just [change the `package.json` file back to your liking](https://github.com/mozilla/addons-contribution-notifier/edit/greenkeeper/update-all/package.json).

Don’t forget to push your changes to this branch, and merge this pull request, so I can start sending you further updates.

<details>
<summary>How to update this pull request</summary>

```bash
# change into your repository’s directory
git fetch
git checkout greenkeeper/update-all
npm install-test
# adapt your code, so it’s working again
git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'
git push origin greenkeeper/update-all
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>

Add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don’t want to update right now.

```js
// package.json
{
  …
  ""greenkeeper"": {
    ""ignore"": [
      ""package-names"",
      ""you-want-me-to-ignore""
    ]
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>How the updates will look like</summary>

As soon as you merge this pull request **I’ll create a branch for every dependency update**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version. Using the results of these tests I’ll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

```diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

In the above example you can see an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When the test services report success I’ll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.
When there is a failure however, I’ll create an issue so you know about the problem immediately.

This way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you’ll get to know of potential problems immediately.

```diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example the new version `4.0.0` is not included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.

Now **you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand** – I’ll just let you know automatically.
And the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update. In case it passes your decent test suite that’s a strong reason to merge right away :shipit:

Let’s get started with automated dependency management for firefox-hardware-report :muscle:



All your dependencies are up-to-date right now, so this repository was enabled right away. Good job :thumbsup:

<summary>🙈 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>

In case you can not, or do not want to update a certain dependency right now, you can of course just [change the `package.json` file back to your liking](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-hardware-report/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).

Add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don’t want to update right now.

```js
// package.json
{
  …
  ""greenkeeper"": {
    ""ignore"": [
      ""package-names"",
      ""you-want-me-to-ignore""
    ]
  }
}
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>👩‍💻 How to update this pull request</summary>

```bash
  # change into your repository’s directory
  git fetch
  git checkout greenkeeper/initial
  npm install-test
  # adapt your code, so it’s working again
  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'
  git push origin greenkeeper/initial
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>✨ How the updates will look like</summary>

As soon as you merge this pull request **I’ll create a branch for every dependency update**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version. Using the results of these tests I’ll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

```diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

In the above example you can see an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When the test services report success I’ll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.
When there is a failure however, I’ll create an issue so you know about the problem immediately.

This way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you’ll get to know of potential problems immediately.

```diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example the new version `4.0.0` is not included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.

Now **you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand** – I’ll just let you know automatically.
And the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update. In case it passes your decent test suite that’s a strong reason to merge right away :shipit:

The version **0.19.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of style-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **6.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of eslint-plugin-node.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

I've also added the `-f` tag as an alternative for the `-o` tag, in line with ctag's behavior.

Both changes will help integrate it with existing editor plugins that were built for ctags.

I noticed that log messages don't get colored.

After spending some time I found that it is mainly because of how we generate output string.
We use `push_str` which requires `&str` as a parameter. So, we have to use `&` and dereference occurs on `ColoredString` instance.

Due to [implementation](https://github.com/mackwic/colored/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L194) of `Deref` for `ColoredString` only  raw text gets returned (without any style attributes).

I tried to use `write!` and it worked.
I also decided to change another `push_str` usages to `write!` for consistency.

What do you think?

I'll just paste those in as a PR description.

When doing local development with the test user, this patch lets you simply surf to /auth/login and a session cookie will be set, skipping the oauth flow completely. All other funky special casing code is gone. Dang, that's nice. (Normally, hitting /auth/login redirects to another endpoint, which redirects to the fxa oauth flow, which eventually ends with a cookie being set, if the oauth stuff worked out successfully.)

Comments welcome!

 chore(server): fixup auth

Correctly use Bell to handle the OAuth nonce. Correctly set and validate
cookies (both that the fxaId exists, and that any TTL hasn't expired).
Fixes #45.

Replace log.trace with log.verbose everywhere, since we never really
want a trace of the function calls.

Enable cookie-based sessions for the visits API, and modify the cookie
validation function to always allow access if the `testUser` config
option is set. Fixes #76.

Add crude placeholder API docs for auth endpoints.

 chore(api): simplify handling of test user

With this patch, we handle the test user by simply setting a cookie as soon as
the user hits the /auth/login endpoint. This is the only bit of special case
code that we need; the cookie is otherwise normal, is validated normally, and
none of the affected routes need any special case code. w00t!

I tried to setup fxa-oauth-console yesterday and I've noticed this error:

This pull-request adds an overlay to all Facebook-specific on-page assets. It targets them in a few ways: 

+ Any element that has the a class of `FacebookConnectButton`
+ Any `href` attribute that contains `facebook`
+ Any `data-oauthserver` attribute that contains `facebook`
+ Any element with a `title` of `share on facebook`
+ Any element with an `aria-label` of `Facebook`

## Known Issues

+ The current method of `HREF` containing `facebook` is too broad. If you search for Facebook on Google, you can see how this doesn't match correctly. 
+ This doesn't address standard implementations of FB login. This will be addressed in a seperate pull-request.  

## Testing

Recreation Steps: 
+ [Run this version](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext#Using_web-ext) of the web extension locally
+ Test one of the test sites

Expected results: 
+ All Facebook subresources will be blocked. (Each attempted resource call will get a console.log) 
+ All on-page Facebook elements get an overlay/slash through it. 

Example test pages: 
+ [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/benhenry/avengers-endgame-mark-ruffalo-streaming-thor )

This pull-request adds an overlay to all Facebook-specific on-page assets. It targets them in a few ways: 

+ Any element that has the a class of `FacebookConnectButton`
+ Any `href` attribute that contains `facebook`
+ Any `data-oauthserver` attribute that contains `facebook`
+ Any element with a `title` of `share on facebook`
+ Any element with an `aria-label` of `Facebook`

## Known Issues

+ The current method of `HREF` containing `facebook` is too broad. If you search for Facebook on Google, you can see how this doesn't match correctly. 
+ This doesn't address standard implementations of FB login. This will be addressed in a seperate pull-request.  

## Testing

Recreation Steps: 
+ [Run this version](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext#Using_web-ext) of the web extension locally
+ Test one of the test sites

Expected results: 
+ All Facebook subresources will be blocked. (Each attempted resource call will get a console.log) 
+ All on-page Facebook elements get an overlay/slash through it.

+ Fixes part of #258 

This pull-request replaces standard implemented FB login and then adds an overlay to it. This replacement is necessary as blocking the Facebook JavaScript SDK completely hides the `.fb-login-button` div. This feature also uses the data-attributes on the div to correctly size/display the replaced element.

This pull-request adds an overlay to all Facebook-specific on-page assets. It targets them in a few ways: 

+ Any element that has the a class of `FacebookConnectButton`
+ Any `href` attribute that contains `facebook`
+ Any `data-oauthserver` attribute that contains `facebook`
+ Any element with a `title` of `share on facebook`
+ Any element with an `aria-label` of `Facebook`

## Known Issues

+ The current method of `HREF` containing `facebook` is too broad. If you search for Facebook on Google, you can see how this doesn't match correctly. 
+ This doesn't address standard implementations of FB login. This will be addressed in a seperate pull-request.  

## Testing

Recreation Steps: 
+ [Run this version](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext#Using_web-ext) of the web extension locally
+ Test one of the test sites

Expected results: 
+ All Facebook subresources will be blocked. (Each attempted resource call will get a console.log) 
+ All on-page Facebook elements get an overlay/slash through it.

5108,1448,1448,mlavin,fxoss,2014-02-03T13:16:21Z,CONTRIBUTOR,True,CMS Model Translation,"Fixes #2.

This is the simplest thing that could possibly work for translating the CMS content. There are still some kinks to work out here but I wanted to get some review started before I got too far out. This adds translation support for the `Page`, `RichTextPage`, `Link`, `Field` and `Form` models built into Mezzanine. Right now it is setup for two languages: English and French. Tested it out locally and it works to show either the English or French version of the page based on the `Accept-Language` header via the `LocaleMiddleware`.

But here are the problems. django-modeltranslation stores the translations in the same table as the model itself. This is very fast but it means that new fields need to be added to the Mezzanine tables. There is a management command `sync_translation_fields` to add them but it's not the easiest workflow. In particular it means adding a new language adds a new column per column to be translated. In the case of the form `Field` model that means 5 more columns per language.

This becomes more of a problem for the Admin forms. Right now it shows all of the languages together in the form. That there is a `title_en` and `title_fr` field one on top of the other. Additional languages make this form even longer. The current `Field` inline barely fits with just two language and adding a third will make this form unusable. The Admin has a built-in language switcher so it might be possible to only show the fields for the selected language. While this would make the form easier to use in some ways it would make it harder to know which languages haven't been completed. It would also make it hard to compare the text in the two languages. It just depends on what the content authors/translators need or want to input this content.

I've tested wiping my entire jupyter/ipython installation, then running the single command 'pip install .' and this grabs the dependencies as expected before installing our extension.

I have not yet tested installing via the remote repo, but I'll can test that once the pull request gets merged. I expected it to work the same as installing from a local directory.

I changed the readme to specify that (at least to the end user installing our extension), manually copying/symlinking gist.js is no longer necessary.

There is a 'pip uninstall' command that exists, and we might want to add support for this in the future. Granted, it doesn't look like Jupyter Notebook uninstalls properly when I run this, so I don't know how much people actually expect that command to work. Implementing seems to be considered optional.

There does exists a way to do a pip install that creates symlinks for development use instead of actually copying files. This would let us run 'pip install -e .' once, then never again while we're developing, and the symlink makes sure we're always running the latest version. I haven't played around with this yet. The old method of manually copying gist.js and setting the config settings to point to the right directories should still work for now.

Having a few people test this on different OSs and different versions of python would be good. If you'd like to test, I'd recommend wiping anything in your .jupyter/.ipython config directories that you set up for this extension (other than the github client id/secret, as shown in the new readme). Also wipe the copy of gist.js you copied manually for development. After doing this, run the notebook to make sure the extension does not appear, then do the pip install and confirm that is does.

Granted, it doesn't look like Jupyter Notebook uninstalls properly when I run this, so I don't know how much people actually expect that command to work. Implementing seems to be considered optional.

There does exists a way to do a pip install that creates symlinks for development use instead of actually copying files. This would let us run 'pip install -e .' once, then never again while we're developing, and the symlink makes sure we're always running the latest version. I haven't played around with this yet. The old method of manually copying gist.js and setting the config settings to point to the right directories should still work for now.

Having a few people test this on different OSs and different versions of python would be good. If you'd like to test, I'd recommend wiping anything in your .jupyter/.ipython config directories that you set up for this extension (other than the github client id/secret, as shown in the new readme). Also wipe the copy of gist.js you copied manually for development. After doing this, run the notebook to make sure the extension does not appear, then do the pip install and confirm that is does.

I've tested wiping my entire jupyter/ipython installation, then running the single command 'pip install .' and this grabs the dependencies as expected before installing our extension.

I have not yet tested installing via the remote repo, but I'll can test that once the pull request gets merged. I expected it to work the same as installing from a local directory.

I changed the readme to specify that (at least to the end user installing our extension), manually copying/symlinking gist.js is no longer necessary.

If you're testing out pip installs, to ""uninstall"" our extension after doing a pip install, wipe the following directories:

This merely updates the build variable.

Note that @bkase and I also recently reviewed and merged @brendandahl's fixes for that Windows crasher. But those changes are all in JS, so they don't require rebuilding the library. We still have a performance/CPU utilization issue with the wait timer on Windows, and we need to work out the library lifecycle issues, but then we should be ready to advertise libadb to a larger audience and get folks using it!

I think that's because it's trying to `cfx xpi` in the _addon/_ directory, which is now just a package of modules, instead of the _helper/_ directory, which contains the _main.js_ and _package.json_ files for the helper addon.

If so, then this is the right fix, although I haven't tested resultant addon package.

Note: The API that we implement is not quite caught up with the spec, and the spec itself may yet change in some minor particulars.

5763,5679,5679,npestana,fxa-local-dev,2016-01-14T22:32:31Z,MEMBER,True,feat(vagrant): add provision script and improve current vagrantfile,"The following sections explains what changed and the reason. The Windows section explains the steps to get the machine working on windows and is here just for reference.

**Vagrantfile**
This file has been improved with the following changes:
1. Load configuration file (yaml) if exists.
2. Updated the format of box dependency declaration.
3. Memory and IP can be defined externally (in yaml file).
4. The atlas push must be configured in the external file.

**vagrant_provision.sh**
This file contains the steps required to build a working development environment.

**local_config.yaml.example**
This file should be duplicated and renamed to 'local_config.yaml' when overriding some configurations.

**servers.json**
Changed to not use the symlink when starting grunt (see windows host section).

**Windows Host**
Using Windows as host is not straight forward and requires some special steps. Why? Because VirtualBox does not support symlinks inside the shared folder. There is a way to get the symlinks working but it comes by default disabled because it can have an unpredictable behaviour.
There was an issue with paths because npm creates the nested tree of dependencies resulting in a path longer than 256 characters, but is already solved in Vagrant 1.8.0 with VirtualBox latest version of 4.3 and 5.

Steps to manually install
1. Install globally the following packages because the install needs to find their executables (does not find them because symlinks are not being created).
sudo npm install -g bower
sudo npm install -g node-pre-gyp
sudo npm install -g browserify
sudo npm install -g uglifyjs
1. Use the following command to set npm to ignore symlink creation (restart the ssh connection after).
   echo ""alias npm='npm --no-bin-links'"" >> ~/.bash_aliases
2. Since linux bash does not nest the alias, we need to change the 'install_all.sh' to manually ignore symlink creation. Run the following script.
   sed -i 's/npm i/npm i --no-bin-links/g' _scripts/install_all.sh
3. We need to tell virtualenv to not create symlinks. Put the following line after wait in 'install_all.sh' script.
   sed -i '/$(VIRTUALENV)/ s/ / --always-copy /' syncserver/Makefile
4. Replace the symlink at the end of 'install_all.sh' script (this will create a wrapper script to simulate the symlink).
   echo -e '#!/bin/bash\nexec ./node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 ""$@""' > pm2; chmod +x pm2

Now you can run 'npm install' as usual. After the install just revert the changes to the script.

Note: I do not recommend using Windows to develop anything related with the current trending web frameworks (even when using Vagrant), but if you really depend on Windows like me (for now), the above steps should help you getting the development machine working.

- Initially I didn't realise the first bullet was  a separate step. I thought it was just explanation for `npm install`. Hence making them all numbered bullets and then clarifying `Manually install...`.
- I don't use bash as my shell, so it was a bit annoying not being able to just copy/paste the `&&`ed commands. Hence splitting them across lines so they work for everyone.
- Added hierarchy to the pm2 bullets so its clear what belongs to what.
- Gave an explicit heading to the troubleshooting section, so that it's easier to spot when people are trying to figure out what's wrong.
- Link to the JDK instead of the JRE in the functional tests section. I tried the JRE but Selenium wouldn't work without the JDK for me.

Improves on the previous PR in two ways:
1. Uses restify's `NotFound` event to catch all requests to unknown paths.
2. Uses the linked fx-auth-db-mem PR to test that the server emits the failure event as expected.

This PR introduces, in order of impact:
- new `prepare_options()`, that's used to initialize the `$options`; later methods don't have to guess anymore; this should fix #18 as well;
- new `rebase_fields()` which replaces most duplicated code with a single, easier to read function;
- new `rebased_options()` which returns `$options` content + specific arrangements for HTTP queries;
- tests for above methods;
- when no JSON configuration is provided in the `<bugzilla>` element, a default working configuration is used, instead of triggering an error.

I am not so sure about:
- the naming of the methods introduced: `prepare_options`, `rebase_fields`, `rebased_options`;
- I moved `fetch()` out of the constructors to help testing objects behavior. It's now triggered through `BugzillaOutput`;
- the exact default failover configuration: I think it's good to set a working default but maybe the default query could be more specific than this one.

Before this change, we were not so sure about the consistency of
the BugzillaQuery $options member: there were several duplicate
tests checking for 'include_fields' existence, type and correctness.

This adds a prepare_options() method which validates configuration
JSON string:
- if it's not a valid JSON, it sets an error as before,
- if it's an empty string or JSON, it sets a working default,

This is an onboarding PR to help you understand and configure Renovate before regular Pull Requests begin. Once you merge or close this Pull Request, Renovate will begin keeping your dependencies up-to-date.

If you have any questions, try reading our [Docs](https://renovateapp.com/docs), particularly the Getting Started section. You can post questions in [our Config Help repository](https://github.com/renovateapp/config-help/issues) or @ the app author @rarkins in this PR and he'll probably see it.

## Detected Package Files

 * `package.json`

## Configuration Summary

Based on the currently configured presets, Renovate will:

  - Start dependency updates once this Configure Renovate PR is merged or closed
  - Separate major versions of dependencies into individual branches/PRs
  - Combine any patch and minor upgrades together into same branch/PR
  - Upgrade to unstable versions only if the existing version is unstable
  - Raise PRs immediately (after branch is created)
  - Use <code>renovate/</code> as prefix for all branch names
  - If semantic commits detected, use semantic commit type <code>fix</code> for dependencies and <code>chore</code> for all others
  - Keep existing branches updated even when not scheduled
  - Disable automerging feature - wait for humans to merge all PRs
  - Ignore `node_modules`, `bower_components`, and various test/tests directories
  - Update existing lock files only when <code>package.json</code> is modified
  - Autodetect whether to pin dependencies or maintain ranges
  - Rate limit PR creation to a maximum of two per hour
  - Limit to maximum 20 concurrent Renovate PRs at any time

Would you like to change the way Renovate is upgrading your dependencies? Simply edit the `renovate.json` in this branch and this Pull Request description will be updated the next time Renovate runs. Try to use Config Presets (the `extends` array) when possible rather than raw config, as then this PR will be able to more accurately describe your settings.

To achieve this it was necessary to change the initialization behavior. The request handler is now always set-up and the check for MAC assignment always happens in the request handlers if it's an FACEBOOK_DOMAIN. Cookies are always cleared on initialization, regardless of MAC assignment. A side-effect is that, if just one specific domain is assigned with MAC, all other FACEBOOK_DOMAINS will still get contained from contain-facebook.

Also makes sure (by awaiting) that the Facebook container is correctly detected or created and hence should avoid that [this](https://github.com/stoically/contain-facebook/blob/1cceca2ccafc28b31dd1c5054ad717b2a5c4488b/background.js#L129-L130) happens.

The test that confirms we reject bad signatures is modifying the _signature_, not the payload, which wouldn't catch a bug like if `sha256()` were returning ""undefined"" all the time (thus causing both sign and verify to use a constant string instead of the real message).

This updates the test to unpack the payload, modify it (by adding a new field), then repack it, before handing it to `verify()` and expecting failure. All tests still pass, fortunately :).

need to assert mozillalabs.com or google.com to test the plugin.",Minion Backend,Python
7532,5735,5735,yeukhon,minion-backend,2014-01-21T02:36:20Z,CONTRIBUTOR,True,Pull request for #284 to rewrite all plugin tests,"Sumamary:

This final patch abstract common codes into base.py. The code should be
much cleaner to read.

+test_robots.py

test_robots.py is one that doesn't use the /test endpoint. It launches three
instances of Flask servers because to test the plugin we need a server that runs
with valid robots.txt, one with invalid robots.txt and one without robots.txt.
- test_hsts.py

test_hsts.py test still rely on external sites (mozillalabs.com and google.com) to
test the existence and absence of HSTS header. We can't launch a local HTTPS server
because minion.curly.get will do certificate check. I need to speak with stefan about
allowing curly to receive an option to enable or disable verification on each call.
- cold boot

If we try to run multiple test files together there will be failure. This seems to be
race condition, the fact that some servers have not been terminated. This is a regression.
One way to solve this is to provide a test runner script that invoke individual test file.
I will file another bug to look at this issue but for now I know each file runs perfectly
fine.
