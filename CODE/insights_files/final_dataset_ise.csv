**Why?**

I couldn't get the server to run locally ( #65 ) in my dev environment. I believe @simonwex was seeing the same issue. 

**What?**
- I replaced `gulp-express` with `gulp-live-server` because that was what `gulp-express` [recommends](https://github.com/gimm/gulp-express). 
- This showed me errors which allowed me to get the app running (needed a Firebase key)
- It also started the server! (Even after fixing the Firebase error, I couldn't get `gulp-express` to work again)

**Why?**

I couldn't get the server to run locally ( #65 ) in my dev environment. I believe @simonwex was seeing the same issue. 

**What?**
- I replaced `gulp-express` with `gulp-live-server` because that was what `gulp-express` [recommends](https://github.com/gimm/gulp-express). 
- This showed me errors which allowed me to get the app running (needed a Firebase key)
- It also started the server! (Even after fixing the Firebase error, I couldn't get `gulp-express` to work again)
- So, if people who know more about these things than me are happy, this seems to work

if I run all the tests for the module it passes, if I single out `TestCsrfMiddleware` it fails

the number of tests run each way adds up though, so it's not skipping anything when I run all

I can see why it fails but I wasn't getting why it passes when you run them all. Now I see it's because the Django request middleware gets set up by `ClientHandler`if you run the other test classes, and this is necessary to have a `request.user` for the csrf middleware to check for.

So strictly speaking it seems like `TestCsrfMiddleware` should also set up request middleware, at least for the failing method that needs `request.user`.

I can see why it fails but I wasn't getting why it passes when you run them all. Now I see it's because the Django request middleware gets set up by `ClientHandler`if you run the other test classes, and this is necessary to have a `request.user` for the csrf middleware to check for.

### Github Survey Data Analysis
https://github.com/avneet14027/Github-Survey-analysis/blob/master/SurveyAnalysis.md <br>
This is a contribution towards Diversity and Inclusion Issue - Visualization Of Github Data. The main goal is here to analyze various factors affecting an individuals contribution to open source. The entire analysis was done in R and is accessible in the form of a markdown file with all the plots included in it. Also, R code has been provided in a separate file within the same repository. Interesting observations came out from this data, the likeliness of men vs women and non binary genders , towards contributing to open source, being employed full time is enormous as compared to the other gender categories. Moreover, an analysis on the various types of contributions and participations have also been done. 
This was also a way for learning R for me through interesting data analysis. 
A variety of visualization techniques like grouped bar charts, simple bar chart, chord diagram, heat-maps etc. were explored for the same.

Programming Language: R
Tools: RStudio
The young people survey is a dataset released by Kaggle about hobbies, interests, certain demographic factors, educational qualification of todays youth, movie and music preferences, personal feelings, personal choices on life struggles, happiness index etc. The goal of this analysis is to ponder upon the nature of today's youth who are going to be leaders of tomorrow. Also, the reason I chose this dataset is to know the general trend among todays youth in terms of music and movie preferences and analyzing social quality of life based on personal factors and decisions. Also, this dataset gives us an insight into the gender gaps as well as gaps in urban and rural life within various aspects of life that need to be contemplated upon.

- A number of initialization variables weren't being reset.
- Made the device loop shutdown consistent. I was getting intermittent failures with the old code since the device loop often remained open during shutdown and devices were being added while things were being freed.

Here I update failure, rocket, rusoto and rust to the latest versions.

I had to point rusoto to a revision, because `rusoto_mock` stopped working after the update. I opened an issue about that https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto/issues/1089.

Because I updated the rust version, there are a bunch of formatting changes in this PR, because fmt was updated as well.

I started the code for the tests, but before finishing it I just wanted to check, because it looks kind of weird to me...

I also added a commit that updates the config.rs version in the Cargo.toml because we had `0.8.0` there, but turns out we use features from the crate that don't exist in that version only on `>=0.9.0`. That was a problem I stumbled on while working on #162 this is why the commit is in this PR.

I started working on this issue, but I'm not really sure I'm doing the right thing. I'm submitting this work in progress so that you can check that this is the kind of tests needed, @philbooth . I started the code for the tests, but before finishing it I just wanted to check, because it looks kind of weird to me...

I also added a commit that updates the config.rs version in the Cargo.toml because we had `0.8.0` there, but turns out we use features from the crate that don't exist in that version only on `>=0.9.0`. That was a problem I stumbled on while working on #162 this is why the commit is in this PR. It was such a small change I didn't think it needed to have a whole PR for itself, but let me know if you want I can do that too.

Placing code that your project relies on to function in `manage.py` is an anti-pattern, as there is no reason to believe that `manage.py` will ever be executed in a production deployment of a Django app; in many common deployment setups it is not.

Fortunately there is a simple and equally functional alternative; if the monkeypatch is done in the root `urls.py` before the url patterns are declared, it will still take effect before views are imported. This pull request recommends that instead.

The setuptools `include_package_data` keyword arg is ineffective without listing the setuptools-git plugin in `setup_requires` (setuptools natively only finds package data in Subversion). Since `setup_requires` plugins cause problems for people installing without a network connection, it's better to just explicitly list the package data using the `package_data` keyword arg.

Due to a bug in distutils in Python versions prior to 2.7, it's also necessary to list that JS file in MANIFEST.in or it may not be included in the sdist.

I've also switched to a plain `from distutils.core import setup` in place of `from setuptools import setup`, since with the removal of `include_package_data` no setuptools-specific features are used anymore.

I've added a resize function and event listener to scale the canvas with correct aspect ration. I've set the canvas size to 320x480 (Portrait mode) initially. Maybe it's a small step towards [Issue #8](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-game-stub/issues/8) 

There are some more changes:
- Hint is now been shown as a overlay which could be hidden by click.
- Install button is positioned at the bottom and floats over the game canvas.

Notes:
I packaged the fxa-python-client and I install it with `pip install fxa-python-client-1.0.0.tar.gz`, so I don't have to do other hacks (to move over the setup.py location and to return, to install git on slaves or to clone the workspace from another job and to exlude the trigger.py when removing the repository)
The tradeoff of this was that I had to make a requirenmens text file and install them with pip install -r

Because we have to add the credentials in config file before ve have an environment, I declare the at the top of the script and create the account just before I ran the testrun. If an exception is thrown and we fail to create the account the build will be aborted, so this is safe. 

For a uid at emai creation I made use of BUILD_TAG variable because is the only one is unique, the BUILD_ID is the timestamp and when running concurrent builds it might duplicate.

1. I ran the advisory pool through my XML parser,  and it choked on a number of **obvious HTML bugs**. There is one commit to address all of these.
2. My link parser then stumbled across a sizable number of **malformed Bugzilla URLs**. This pull request addresses these, too. Some are particularly regular, having certain bug IDs prefixed with **&amp;#10;**, suggesting they were created by a **broken extraction or conversion script** incorrectly handling line breaks inside of URLs.
3. Lastly I found a line-broken _title_ in the header of one advisory which later turned out to be the result of a **duplication of the title**, likely due to a copy&paste issue.
#### Headers

I touched two **advisory headers** to make them **consistent** with the rest:

This pull request's main goal is to update freeze-dry from 0.2.0 to 0.2.4. freeze-dry 0.2.1 introduces postcss as a dependency, which rollup does not like due to a circular dependency postcss contains (see the linked issue in #34). A potential solution to this problem is using a rollup plugin that bundles postcss using webpack (eliminating the circular dependency) before rollup then bundles postcss up along with the rest of the codebase. The rollup plugin comes from the issue linked in #34 and [feels awkward](https://gist.github.com/tivac/d3dd0142e7c52d0d0a5a05b6686340e3). But it does work.

I updated the other dependencies before stumbling across this rollup plugin solution and had hoped simply updating them would solve the problem. It did not, but I have not gone back to see if the plugin solution works without updating the other dependencies. Since everything is working with the dependencies updated (though the syntax for the copy plugin needed to change), I think we should be okay with updating them. The naive assumption being that the dependencies are better in their newer versions.

freeze-dry 0.2.4 does bring immense performance increases (as I will post in #38).

This PR adds a check for `undefined` feature values during vectorization. This allows you to notice a certain class of ruleset errors during vectorization instead of during training.

New layout:

The db-server dep is moved in at the root level and required as a dependency by package.json and the mem bits are now intermixed in bin and lib. This allows everything to be in sync while allowing us to publish fxa-auth-db-server as a module to npm for 3rd party implementations. 

Eventually we might want to rename this repo to reflect that its not just mysql, but its no big deal to leave it, and nothing will need to change for fxa-dev or prod. I've already got this running locally with fxa-auth-server with only a few minor changes.

> Version 0.15.3
> --------------
> 
> Released 2019-05-14
> 
> -   Properly handle multi-line header folding in development server in
>     Python 2.7. (:issue:`1080`)
> -   Restore the ``response`` argument to :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized`.
>     (:pr:`1527`)
> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` doesn't add the ``WWW-Authenticate``
>     header if ``www_authenticate`` is not given. (:issue:`1516`)
> -   The default URL converter correctly encodes bytes to string rather
>     than representing them with ``b''``. (:issue:`1502`)
> -   Fix the filename format string in
>     :class:`~middleware.profiler.ProfilerMiddleware` to correctly handle
>     float values. (:issue:`1511`)
> -   Update :class:`~middleware.lint.LintMiddleware` to work on Python 3.
>     (:issue:`1510`)
> -   The debugger detects cycles in chained exceptions and does not time
>     out in that case. (:issue:`1536`)
> -   When running the development server in Docker, the debugger security
>     pin is now unique per container.
> 
> 
> Version 0.15.2
> --------------
> 
> Released 2019-04-02
> 
> -   ``Rule`` code generation uses a filename that coverage will ignore.
>     The previous value, ""generated"", was causing coverage to fail.
>     (:issue:`1487`)
> -   The test client removes the cookie header if there are no persisted
>     cookies. This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies
>     from the original request were used for redirects, causing functions
>     such as logout to fail. (:issue:`1491`)
> -   The test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to
>     prevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.
>     (:issue:`1498`)
> -   The ``""werkzeug""`` logger only adds a handler if there is no handler
>     configured for its level in the logging chain. This avoids double
>     logging if other code configures logging first. (:issue:`1492`)
> 
> 
> Version 0.15.1
> --------------
> 
> Released 2019-03-21
> 
> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` takes ``description`` as the first
></tr></table> ... (truncated)

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add ""no-prototype-builtins"" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of ""properties that must be enumerable"".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the ""lookup""-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

and permissions with Flask-Principal

My concern with this is whether ""roles"" are the thing we want to organize around.  The other option is ""permissions"".  Some examples might distinguish:

Roles:
- `userauth.admin`, `mapper.reporter`, `clobberer.developer`

Permissions:
- `userauth.perms.edit`, `mapper.mapping.insert`, `clobberer.clobber.branch`

I lean toward roles since we'll be mapping LDAP groups, which tend to be role-based.  But permissions seem to be more explicit (""you can do this thing"").  Also, when we get into API-based access, we'll want users to be able to grant limited permissions to other applications, which doesn't map well to roles.

This could be pretty easily reconfigured to support permissions with little more than `s/role/permission/g`, so there aren't a lot of technical reasons to prefer one over the other.

Also, switch from ""keyup"" event to ""input"". This makes editing the search terms without pressing keys (e.g., selecting Cut or Paste from a menu) works.

Redo much of the CSS:
* Get rid of overspecified selectors.
* Kill inline styling.

Instead, we now only walk the sessions in the first room the user joined. `get_sessions` could also be refactored but proved challenging for me.

Also it seems that `get_publisher` assumes a user is only publishing in one room (ie, has one subscriber offer across all of their joined rooms), but `get_sessions` assumes a user can be joined in several rooms. So this PR may be a bad idea, since the new hashmap now assumes a user is going to publish from the first room they join. I wasn't sure of the original assumptions being made in switchboard - in practice users only join one room in hubs for both publishing and subscribing. This PR assumes that the first room a user joins is the one they will be publishing in - if that isn't the case (ie they join two rooms, and publish in the second one), the hashmap will register them in the wrong room and their publisher will not be discoverable. However I believe currently the SFU requires publishing in all joined rooms for other reasons, so maybe this is a moot point.

This pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point. I will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, **as soon as you merge this pull request**.

## ✅ If this pull request passes and everything is still working

This is really good news. Merge this pull request and I will keep you posted about dependency updates you shouldn’t miss.

## ❌ If this pull request fails and things aren’t working

**Note: I won’t start sending you further updates, unless you have merged this very pull request**.

So, how do we proceed? I suggest you find out what dependency update is causing the problem. Adapt your code so things are working nicely together again. [next-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update) is a really handy tool to help you with this.

Push the changes to this branch and merge it.

In case you can not, or do not want to update a certain dependency right now, you can of course just [change the `package.json` file back to your liking](https://github.com/mozilla/addons-contribution-notifier/edit/greenkeeper/update-all/package.json).

Don’t forget to push your changes to this branch, and merge this pull request, so I can start sending you further updates.

As soon as you merge this pull request **I’ll create a branch for every dependency update**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version. Using the results of these tests I’ll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

```diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

In the above example you can see an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When the test services report success I’ll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.
When there is a failure however, I’ll create an issue so you know about the problem immediately.

This way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you’ll get to know of potential problems immediately.

```diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example the new version `4.0.0` is not included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.

Now **you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand** – I’ll just let you know automatically.
And the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update. In case it passes your decent test suite that’s a strong reason to merge right away :shipit:

The version **3.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint-plugin-standard.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **2.8.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of eslint-plugin-import.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

This is the first automated pull requests to help reach the goal of up to date and stable software.
It updates all of the dependencies in the `package.json` in one go, but from now on you’ll receive **pull requests** for each dependency update **in isolation and in real time**.

For updates that satisfy the existing version range you’ll get pull-requests only if it breaks your build.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

When an update does not satisfy the existing range you’ll get the pull request right away.

Example:

I've added the ability for jsctags to print to stdout.

I've also added the `-f` tag as an alternative for the `-o` tag, in line with ctag's behavior.

Both changes will help integrate it with existing editor plugins that were built for ctags.

I sent this pull request to pcwalton's branch previously, but it seems to have disappeared.. seeing as there's an official mozilla branch now, I'm trying again. Hope to hear from you guys.

I noticed that log messages don't get colored.

After spending some time I found that it is mainly because of how we generate output string.
We use `push_str` which requires `&str` as a parameter. So, we have to use `&` and dereference occurs on `ColoredString` instance.

Due to [implementation](https://github.com/mackwic/colored/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L194) of `Deref` for `ColoredString` only  raw text gets returned (without any style attributes).

I tried to use `write!` and it worked.
I also decided to change another `push_str` usages to `write!` for consistency.

I thought about test yesterday but I wasn't sure how I could check that string was really colored.

Today I realized that I could just check color's codes in string.
It seems to work fine: fails on before-patch version and passes on after-patch one.

I'll just paste those in as a PR description.

When doing local development with the test user, this patch lets you simply surf to /auth/login and a session cookie will be set, skipping the oauth flow completely. All other funky special casing code is gone. Dang, that's nice. (Normally, hitting /auth/login redirects to another endpoint, which redirects to the fxa oauth flow, which eventually ends with a cookie being set, if the oauth stuff worked out successfully.)

Comments welcome!

 chore(server): fixup auth

Correctly use Bell to handle the OAuth nonce. Correctly set and validate
cookies (both that the fxaId exists, and that any TTL hasn't expired).
Fixes #45.

Replace log.trace with log.verbose everywhere, since we never really
want a trace of the function calls.

Enable cookie-based sessions for the visits API, and modify the cookie
validation function to always allow access if the `testUser` config
option is set. Fixes #76.

Add crude placeholder API docs for auth endpoints.

 chore(api): simplify handling of test user

With this patch, we handle the test user by simply setting a cookie as soon as
the user hits the /auth/login endpoint. This is the only bit of special case
code that we need; the cookie is otherwise normal, is validated normally, and
none of the affected routes need any special case code. w00t!

This required light modification of the validation as well as handling the new ""unverified-email"" field.

I'm happy to just always set this in a profile capability if you'd rather users do it that way. I only suggest this because in the Java and Python client bindings (and probably others), if you construct a new FirefoxProfile(), it contains this pref by default, which means that the popup blocker is enabled if you omit the `firefox_profile` capability, but disabled if you pass a profile created with the default constructor and no further modifications.

(But perhaps that should just be the client's problem, in the end.)

The regex check I commented out in `sanitizer.py` appears to suffer from a hang, when fed the inline styles that appear in the new test. 

Of course, the funny thing is that all tests pass with this regex check commented out, so it might not be that important after all? :)

FWIW, as crazy as it looks, this is data ""in the wild"" from [a page on the MDN wiki](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey/Build_Documentation), and it causes the migration process to come to a halt.

I haven't spent too much time dissecting the regex itself, yet. But, I have found that the length of the hang can be reduced by removing some of the styles. I haven't been able to narrow it down to just one style, though. So, that makes me think that it's not an infinite loop per se, but just a very very long process for this given set of inline styles. 

However, the hang is so long on my laptop that it never finished for me after letting it go while I wandered off for an hour for lunch. That seems troublesome.

I want to use cachify in an express 3 project but I get this error : 

> TypeError: Object #<ServerResponse> has no method 'local'
> at Object.exports.setup [as handle] (node_modules/connect-cachify/lib/connect-cachify.js:54:10)

_resp.local_ does not exist anymore in express3, it has been replaced with _resp.locals_
So I replaced the 3 lines using resp.local with the following code and it works  :

```
resp.locals({
      'cachify_js': cachify_js,
      'cachify_css': cachify_css,
      'cachify': cachify
    });
```

Is it possible to support express 3 without breaking compatibility with older versions ?

Firstly I want to thank you for developing this project!

Last day I wanted to compile `node-janus` but I wasn't able to do that due to a compilation error. After having a look to the error, it seems that it was due to the installation of `janus-image-worker`:

```
✓ mozjpeg downloaded successfully
✓ jpeg turbo downloaded successfully
✓ jpeg-turbo built successfully.
✓ mozjpeg built successfully.

✗ Unable to build image recompressor.
/bin/sh: 1: ./configure: not found
```

Most of the files were missing due to the `files` key in `packages.json` file. It's a problem when we have to build the recompressor because we need all files needed to compile this project.
This is why I removed the `files` key.

Maybe there is a better solution but it seems this one will fix the problem :-)

Have a good day,

Matt

This pull-request adds an overlay to all Facebook-specific on-page assets. It targets them in a few ways: 

+ Any element that has the a class of `FacebookConnectButton`
+ Any `href` attribute that contains `facebook`
+ Any `data-oauthserver` attribute that contains `facebook`
+ Any element with a `title` of `share on facebook`
+ Any element with an `aria-label` of `Facebook`

## Known Issues

+ The current method of `HREF` containing `facebook` is too broad. If you search for Facebook on Google, you can see how this doesn't match correctly. 
+ This doesn't address standard implementations of FB login. This will be addressed in a seperate pull-request.  

## Testing

Recreation Steps: 
+ [Run this version](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext#Using_web-ext) of the web extension locally
+ Test one of the test sites

Expected results: 
+ All Facebook subresources will be blocked. (Each attempted resource call will get a console.log) 
+ All on-page Facebook elements get an overlay/slash through it.

+ Fixes part of #258 

This pull-request replaces standard implemented FB login and then adds an overlay to it. This replacement is necessary as blocking the Facebook JavaScript SDK completely hides the `.fb-login-button` div. This feature also uses the data-attributes on the div to correctly size/display the replaced element.

This pull-request adds an overlay to all Facebook-specific on-page assets. It targets them in a few ways: 

+ Any element that has the a class of `FacebookConnectButton`
+ Any `href` attribute that contains `facebook`
+ Any `data-oauthserver` attribute that contains `facebook`
+ Any element with a `title` of `share on facebook`
+ Any element with an `aria-label` of `Facebook`

## Known Issues

+ The current method of `HREF` containing `facebook` is too broad. If you search for Facebook on Google, you can see how this doesn't match correctly. 
+ This doesn't address standard implementations of FB login. This will be addressed in a seperate pull-request.

8450,1448,1448,1448,mlavin,fxoss,2014-02-03T13:16:21Z,CONTRIBUTOR,True,CMS Model Translation,"Fixes #2.

This is the simplest thing that could possibly work for translating the CMS content. There are still some kinks to work out here but I wanted to get some review started before I got too far out. This adds translation support for the `Page`, `RichTextPage`, `Link`, `Field` and `Form` models built into Mezzanine. Right now it is setup for two languages: English and French. Tested it out locally and it works to show either the English or French version of the page based on the `Accept-Language` header via the `LocaleMiddleware`.

But here are the problems. django-modeltranslation stores the translations in the same table as the model itself. This is very fast but it means that new fields need to be added to the Mezzanine tables. There is a management command `sync_translation_fields` to add them but it's not the easiest workflow. In particular it means adding a new language adds a new column per column to be translated. In the case of the form `Field` model that means 5 more columns per language.

This becomes more of a problem for the Admin forms. Right now it shows all of the languages together in the form. That there is a `title_en` and `title_fr` field one on top of the other. Additional languages make this form even longer. The current `Field` inline barely fits with just two language and adding a third will make this form unusable. The Admin has a built-in language switcher so it might be possible to only show the fields for the selected language. While this would make the form easier to use in some ways it would make it harder to know which languages haven't been completed. It would also make it hard to compare the text in the two languages. It just depends on what the content authors/translators need or want to input this content.

This change does make the user IDs returned in signalling responses into strings, which could break client code, but ours is resilient to that (and since IDs are opaque and only good for comparing equality probably other code is also resilient to that.)",2018-04-10T02:11:30Z,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/janus-plugin-sfu/pulls/12,127.0,84.0,43.0,2018-04-10T02:06:57Z,11c92f24e328780127477b31c1a3030a5992bb72,11c92f24e328780127477b31c1a3030a5992bb72,"Store, accept string room and user IDs",Janus plugin to act as a kind of SFU for game networking data.,Rust

- You can now send ""block"" and ""unblock"" signalling messages to the server, specifying a user ID you wish to block or unblock.
- These manipulate the state of an in-memory database of blocks, and send an event to the target user that they have been blocked or unblocked.
- When forwarding packets, we respect these blocks. No audio, video, or data will be sent from blockers to their blockees, or from blockees to their blockers.

There is a known issue with video transmission, where when a blocked video stream is unblocked Janus will interpret the gap as packet loss and start sending a ton of NACKs. I'm researching the best approach to this. It could be that we will want to advise clients to unsubscribe from media traffic of blockers or blockees. The code surrounding the block data structures is also a little messy.

This branch renames `options.locales` to `options.languages` so that it's clearer a list of langs not locales should be supplied. E.g. a lang code is en-US whereas a locale for that code would be en_US.

Subsequently the locales are then created based on lang codes so en-US will result in the en_US locale.

At the same time I've cleaned up the repo references to point here and bumped the version.

I have not yet tested installing via the remote repo, but I'll can test that once the pull request gets merged. I expected it to work the same as installing from a local directory.

I changed the readme to specify that (at least to the end user installing our extension), manually copying/symlinking gist.js is no longer necessary.

Granted, it doesn't look like Jupyter Notebook uninstalls properly when I run this, so I don't know how much people actually expect that command to work. Implementing seems to be considered optional.

There does exists a way to do a pip install that creates symlinks for development use instead of actually copying files. This would let us run 'pip install -e .' once, then never again while we're developing, and the symlink makes sure we're always running the latest version. I haven't played around with this yet. The old method of manually copying gist.js and setting the config settings to point to the right directories should still work for now.

Having a few people test this on different OSs and different versions of python would be good. If you'd like to test, I'd recommend wiping anything in your .jupyter/.ipython config directories that you set up for this extension (other than the github client id/secret, as shown in the new readme). Also wipe the copy of gist.js you copied manually for development. After doing this, run the notebook to make sure the extension does not appear, then do the pip install and confirm that is does.

The old method of manually copying gist.js and setting the config settings to point to the right directories should still work for now.

Having a few people test this on different OSs and different versions of python would be good. If you'd like to test, I'd recommend wiping anything in your .jupyter/.ipython config directories that you set up for this extension (other than the github client id/secret, as shown in the new readme). Also wipe the copy of gist.js you copied manually for development. After doing this, run the notebook to make sure the extension does not appear, then do the pip install and confirm that is does.

There are no code changes here, because the code in android-tools/ is already up-to-date, so `make LIBADB_LOCATION=local` already builds the latest version locally. This merely updates the build variable.

Note that @bkase and I also recently reviewed and merged @brendandahl's fixes for that Windows crasher. But those changes are all in JS, so they don't require rebuilding the library. We still have a performance/CPU utilization issue with the wait timer on Windows, and we need to work out the library lifecycle issues, but then we should be ready to advertise libadb to a larger audience and get folks using it!

I think that's because it's trying to `cfx xpi` in the _addon/_ directory, which is now just a package of modules, instead of the _helper/_ directory, which contains the _main.js_ and _package.json_ files for the helper addon.

If so, then this is the right fix, although I haven't tested resultant addon package.

I expect to add more but I thought we'd start with something simple as a trial balloon.

Note: The API that we implement is not quite caught up with the spec, and the spec itself may yet change in some minor particulars. Therefore, I'll have to keep these tests synchronized, and we can expect that there may be a slight lag between when I push a change to the API and when the AWFY tests are updated. I guess that's ok? Alternatively, we could wait to add any tests, but I'd rather get perf feedback sooner than later.

9719,5679,5679,5679,npestana,fxa-local-dev,2016-01-14T22:32:31Z,MEMBER,True,feat(vagrant): add provision script and improve current vagrantfile,"The following sections explains what changed and the reason. The Windows section explains the steps to get the machine working on windows and is here just for reference.

**Vagrantfile**
This file has been improved with the following changes:
1. Load configuration file (yaml) if exists.
2. Updated the format of box dependency declaration.
3. Memory and IP can be defined externally (in yaml file).
4. The atlas push must be configured in the external file.

**vagrant_provision.sh**
This file contains the steps required to build a working development environment.

**local_config.yaml.example**
This file should be duplicated and renamed to 'local_config.yaml' when overriding some configurations.

**servers.json**
Changed to not use the symlink when starting grunt (see windows host section).

**Windows Host**
Using Windows as host is not straight forward and requires some special steps. Why? Because VirtualBox does not support symlinks inside the shared folder. There is a way to get the symlinks working but it comes by default disabled because it can have an unpredictable behaviour.
There was an issue with paths because npm creates the nested tree of dependencies resulting in a path longer than 256 characters, but is already solved in Vagrant 1.8.0 with VirtualBox latest version of 4.3 and 5.

Steps to manually install
1. Install globally the following packages because the install needs to find their executables (does not find them because symlinks are not being created).
sudo npm install -g bower
sudo npm install -g node-pre-gyp
sudo npm install -g browserify
sudo npm install -g uglifyjs
1. Use the following command to set npm to ignore symlink creation (restart the ssh connection after).
   echo ""alias npm='npm --no-bin-links'"" >> ~/.bash_aliases
2. Since linux bash does not nest the alias, we need to change the 'install_all.sh' to manually ignore symlink creation. Run the following script.
   sed -i 's/npm i/npm i --no-bin-links/g' _scripts/install_all.sh
3. We need to tell virtualenv to not create symlinks. Put the following line after wait in 'install_all.sh' script.
   sed -i '/$(VIRTUALENV)/ s/ / --always-copy /' syncserver/Makefile
4. Replace the symlink at the end of 'install_all.sh' script (this will create a wrapper script to simulate the symlink).
   echo -e '#!/bin/bash\nexec ./node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 ""$@""' > pm2; chmod +x pm2

Now you can run 'npm install' as usual. After the install just revert the changes to the script.

Note: I do not recommend using Windows to develop anything related with the current trending web frameworks (even when using Vagrant), but if you really depend on Windows like me (for now), the above steps should help you getting the development machine working.

Added an npm-shrinkwrap.json file and a few helpers:
- `npm run outdated`: lists outdated modules to console (or Travis log).
- `npm run shrinkwrap`: calls `npm shrinkwrap` and then calls `grunt validate-shrinkwrap`. This currently excludes `devDependencies` but it's an easy tweak if we decide to pin the version numbers instead of using semver range operators or `x`.
- `grunt validate-shrinkwrap`: validates the npm-shrinkwrap.json file against nodesecurity.io database.

A review request for you! Basically, I spotted this repo was failing in travis from looking at http://egeloen.fr/travis-wall/#/petemoore and then I noticed there are no irc notifications, so this might be why nobody noticed. Therefore I added irc notifications to it. We got this from the last build:

- Added hierarchy to the pm2 bullets so its clear what belongs to what.
- Gave an explicit heading to the troubleshooting section, so that it's easier to spot when people are trying to figure out what's wrong.
- Link to the JDK instead of the JRE in the functional tests section. I tried the JRE but Selenium wouldn't work without the JDK for me.

@vladikoff, are you the person most interested in reviewing this?

Revised from #154, fixes #144, depends on https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-db-mem/pull/39.

Improves on the previous PR in two ways:
1. Uses restify's `NotFound` event to catch all requests to unknown paths.
2. Uses the linked fx-auth-db-mem PR to test that the server emits the failure event as expected.

Any good?

This PR introduces, in order of impact:
- new `prepare_options()`, that's used to initialize the `$options`; later methods don't have to guess anymore; this should fix #18 as well;
- new `rebase_fields()` which replaces most duplicated code with a single, easier to read function;
- new `rebased_options()` which returns `$options` content + specific arrangements for HTTP queries;
- tests for above methods;
- when no JSON configuration is provided in the `<bugzilla>` element, a default working configuration is used, instead of triggering an error.

I am not so sure about:
- the naming of the methods introduced: `prepare_options`, `rebase_fields`, `rebased_options`;
- I moved `fetch()` out of the constructors to help testing objects behavior. It's now triggered through `BugzillaOutput`;

## Detected Package Files

 * `package.json`

## Configuration Summary

Based on the currently configured presets, Renovate will:

  - Start dependency updates once this Configure Renovate PR is merged or closed
  - Separate major versions of dependencies into individual branches/PRs
  - Combine any patch and minor upgrades together into same branch/PR
  - Upgrade to unstable versions only if the existing version is unstable
  - Raise PRs immediately (after branch is created)
  - Use <code>renovate/</code> as prefix for all branch names
  - If semantic commits detected, use semantic commit type <code>fix</code> for dependencies and <code>chore</code> for all others
  - Keep existing branches updated even when not scheduled
  - Disable automerging feature - wait for humans to merge all PRs
  - Ignore `node_modules`, `bower_components`, and various test/tests directories
  - Update existing lock files only when <code>package.json</code> is modified
  - Autodetect whether to pin dependencies or maintain ranges
  - Rate limit PR creation to a maximum of two per hour
  - Limit to maximum 20 concurrent Renovate PRs at any time

Would you like to change the way Renovate is upgrading your dependencies? Simply edit the `renovate.json` in this branch and this Pull Request description will be updated the next time Renovate runs. Try to use Config Presets (the `extends` array) when possible rather than raw config, as then this PR will be able to more accurately describe your settings.

To achieve this it was necessary to change the initialization behavior. The request handler is now always set-up and the check for MAC assignment always happens in the request handlers if it's an FACEBOOK_DOMAIN. Cookies are always cleared on initialization, regardless of MAC assignment. A side-effect is that, if just one specific domain is assigned with MAC, all other FACEBOOK_DOMAINS will still get contained from contain-facebook.

Also makes sure (by awaiting) that the Facebook container is correctly detected or created and hence should avoid that [this](https://github.com/stoically/contain-facebook/blob/1cceca2ccafc28b31dd1c5054ad717b2a5c4488b/background.js#L129-L130) happens.

The test that confirms we reject bad signatures is modifying the _signature_, not the payload, which wouldn't catch a bug like if `sha256()` were returning ""undefined"" all the time (thus causing both sign and verify to use a constant string instead of the real message).

This updates the test to unpack the payload, modify it (by adding a new field), then repack it, before handing it to `verify()` and expecting failure. All tests still pass, fortunately :).

I've stumbled upon an issue today when installing html5lib. Since version 0.95 the init signature adds a parser argument that's missing from the BleachSanitizer. So, i just extended it to accept keyword values arguments, this way any further changes in html5lib will be compatible with Bleach.
Regards,
