Abilities for now:

string, currently based on string matching
- function definition meant to take all filters as parameters and return
vector of those rules that match all the rules
- Added few ip based helper functions, and testing functions in main.cpp

@todo -
1. complete the getrulesbyfilter(), remove the first overloaded function
for this,
- write a function that reads json and call the get...() function in
appropriate manner
- write a function that parses the vector returned and creates json
