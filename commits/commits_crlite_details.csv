This by default generates an `mlbf` file named `filter.stash`, which contains
all the additions to the filter, collated by issuer and status change.

The file is made of per-issuer blocks, where each block's bytes are:

  bytes 0-3: N, number of revoked serials as an unsigned long
  bytes 4-7: M, number of nonrevoked serials as an unsigned long
  bytes 8-9: L, length of the issuer field as a unsigned short
  bytes 10+: hash of issuer subject public key info of length L
  ... then N serials_structs
  ... followed by M serials_structs

The serials_struct blocks are defined:
  bytes 0-1: S, length of serial field as an unsigned short
  bytes 2+: ASN.1 DER-encoded serial number of length S

When reaching EOF, there are no more issuer blocks.

The expand-and-copy mechanism wasn't correct, and led to serial data loss, as
was shown via the new assertion I've added. Local benchnarking indicates that
the performance improvement from the expansion mechanism wasn't significant,
that append() is smart enough now that if I give it a slice, it will expand
to fit that slice (and some extra), so it's not a naive implementation in the
current versions of Go.

Require all issuer CRLs to be valid and up-to-date to include that issuer in
the enrolled list, instead of at least one CRL be valid (a low bar)!

* Emit audit information about processed CRLs

Emit audit blocks for ALL crls, including those processed, so we can
evaluate on a per-issuer basis how many CRLs were processed.

Still doesn't emit unique per-CRL identifiers (e.g., URL), which will be a
follow-on commit

* Always emit URLs in the Audit Logs, even when there's a local path known

* CRLs that never download should count against the Issuer for enrollment

CRLs that fail during the downloader due to not being on-disk were being
consumed early, keeping them from affecting the determination of Enrolled
during the verification step. Pass the broken links through with sentinel
empty paths to count them as being broken.

* ""Very Old, Blocked"" is patently misleading

""Very Old, Blocked"" is misleading, as they get processed, and we allow even
expired CRLs.

I think we should still warn on old CRLs, especially in the audit, but let's
put ""Warning"" in the status text instead of ""Blocked"", since it's Not Blocked.

* Make the Kinto Publisher check that signatures are needed before requesting signatures

As it was, the `crlite_sign` and `intermediates_sign` methods always signed when
called, so every time the k8s job ran to sign, the signer actually did work.
This change is to check the state of the collection to be `""to-review""` before
requesting a signature.

Since I don't have a kinto-signer instance working locally, this was tested on
stage by manipulating the crlite records and rolling it back when done.

empty paths to count them as being broken.
