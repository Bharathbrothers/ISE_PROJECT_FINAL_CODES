My initial impression is this makes it easier to reason about the code. Block scope certainly decreases the amount of state you have to think about at any one time. There's no sense requiring functions or classes to be defined in specific orders, though; this isn't C, and they're still hoisted in ES6.

The fact that it's a function is not unique: notes() and score() take functions as well. props() is more descriptive than func(): it suggests the return value, which is what other callback-taking calls also are named after.

Considered names:

* func()  # abbreviation :-( but a well known one
* facts()  # inaccurate: returns a single fact
* fact()  # doesn't necessarily return a whole fact; can layer with rightward calls
* all()  # want to reserve this for quantifiers
* everything()  # Makes it clear that it overrides any previous calls, no matter their kind. Might suggest a reach outside this rule
* hash()  # not a very JS term
* custom()  # is it more custom than a note() or score() callback?
* obj()  # too generic, abbrev
* properties()  # long
* props()  # abbrevation :-( but a well-known one. I like that it focuses your attention on the individual properties returned and on the per-subfact layering with other chained calls.
* subfacts()  # accurate, but so far we haven't made the user know about facts, and I don't want to start now",Erik Rose,2017-01-26T21:02:10Z,erikrose,erikrose,104,52,52

This removes the user's need to care about Fathom's laziness, as far as I can recall right now.

As a bonus, this allows us to avoid eager-computing the entire ruleset when a ruleset is asked about a specific DOM node: now it can just happily return fnodes which compute on demand.

Factor out the non-eager bits into dedicated ""soFar"" routines on Fnode so tests that test our laziness could still call them and so, in one place, the executor wouldn't get into an infinite recursion.

Remove the TODO about enumerating the types on a fnode. We won't provide a way to enumerate themâ€”at least not without a compelling demonstration that it's usefulâ€”as that would require running an entire ruleset to exhaustion. Making callers ask about types individually using hasType() lets us remain lazy. Making hasType() eager-compute the asked-about type makes this pattern usable for situations where you're interested in whether the page as a whole is classified as various types.",Erik Rose,2017-01-18T22:14:17Z,erikrose,erikrose,79,46,33

This is the result of a lot of mental wrestling and discussion with potential users. Basically, I wanted to be more concise without being misleadingly inconsistent. Having max(4) meaning one thing (""top 4"") on the LHS and another (""at most, the score 4"") on the RHS was unacceptable. I'd actually prefer ""top"" for the LHS, but ""max"" is already in place in code and minds, and it's 90% as good. Other contenders for ""atMost"" were most() (whose inverse, least(), on the LHS would falsely suggest ""the lowest ones"") and under() (which is technically incorrect and so leads to having to read it and then readjust your thought each time).
