* Make LocaleURLMiddleware clean up after itself: clear the thread-local prefixer variable that it sets before the request. Tests can now run in any order without the thread-local setting of one influencing the next. This also uncovers a lot of buggy tests which were mistakenly depending on the work of previous ones. Much of the rest of this changeset is toward fixing these.... A good test to compare before and after this commit is `test_json_callback_validation`. Run it alone, and LocaleMiddleware tosses us a 301 because we don't have a locale prefix set. Run it in concert with other tests, and somebody else sets the thread-local for it.
* Added `LocalizingClient`, which provides the functionality of django.test.client.Client but implicitly prepends a locale code to anything you request. This saves dodging the initial 301 that LocaleURLMiddleware returns in response to an un-prepended request. It also makes ""priming"" the middleware by doing an initial arbitrary request unnecessary (and ineffective, since the middleware no longer leaks state). Removed all instances of such priming.
* Switched many tests to use `LocalizingClient`. Some uses of plain `Client` remain, but those are correct, since they test things like the middleware's 301s.
* Renamed `set_url_prefix` and `get_url_prefix` to better reflect their purpose: they hold Prefixers, not prefixes.
* Added a `force_locale` kwarg to `sumo.urlresolvers.reverse()`, which forces the same default locale as would normally be used by the middleware to be prepended onto the result, even if there is no prefixer set. This is useful when you need to get a reversed URL against which to compare a 301's Location in a test.
* Moved `split_path()` out of `Prefixer`, since it needs no instance state and I needed it in `LocalizingClient`.
* `Prefixer` can now be instantiated without a request, in which case it defaults to a fairly blank one and returns results largely determined by `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE`.
* Stopped expecting locale prefixes in wiki parser tests: the parser is being run outside any request and so should return unlocalized URLs.
* Ripped `get_url` off the legacy `Forum` and `ForumThread` models and deleted its tests. This was a lot faster than trying to fix them, and the entire models are dying for 2.3 anyway.
* Fixed a gabillion other tests. I like to think I understood each one's intent before causing it to pass, but extra eyes are certainly welcome.
* Fixed some pyflakes violations: semicolons, whitespace, unused imports, etc.",Erik Rose,2010-08-27T00:31:33Z,erikrose,erikrose,2,1,1
