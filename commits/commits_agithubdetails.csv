  * if the `paginate` parameter is true, look in the payload of the response
    page for a [link header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) and if found
    extend the fetched data by calling the `get_additional_pages` method
* Create the `no_ratelimit_remaining` method to check if there are no
  remaining requests allowed
* Create the `get_additional_pages` method which calls the
  `get_next_link_url` method to determine if there are additional pages. If
  so, fetch the next page and recursively continue fetching pages until the
  last page is fetched
* Create the `get_next_link_url` method which parses the link header and

    extend the fetched data by calling the `get_additional_pages` method
* Create the `no_ratelimit_remaining` method to check if there are no
  remaining requests allowed
* Create the `get_additional_pages` method which calls the
  `get_next_link_url` method to determine if there are additional pages. If
  so, fetch the next page and recursively continue fetching pages until the
  last page is fetched
* Create the `get_next_link_url` method which parses the link header and
