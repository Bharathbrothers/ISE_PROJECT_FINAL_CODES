If we're sticking to the ""use plain language"" tenet of Gov.uk's styleguide I think ""demographic"" is too marketing of a term for ""types of humans"". To me it feels less inclusive simply because it's a bit of a jargon word. Being really explicit about which humans you're talking about and then leaving this as an open doc means there's room to add and evolve.
