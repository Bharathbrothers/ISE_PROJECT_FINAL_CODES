Problem:

Most of these issues is caused by sites are not being added groups when
a site is being created. Some part of the documentation was not clear
either. I also overlooked at some of the issues.

Solution:

This commit appends the site url to each group
specified by ``groups``. Furthermore, the ``_call(..)`` function in the
function test has been modified to remove 'application/json' from GET
request to prevent Flask from complaining.

Problems remain to be solved:

1. When a group is created, owner should be included automatically. This
is trivial fix; require user to be added as part of the request, and
add user to the default list instead of an ``[]`` list.

2. Review documentations.

3. We still want a few more individual functional tests for
/report/issues.

This basic validator will address some of the concerns in #11 and in
ticket #36. We are rejecting all requests returning non-200 response. If
the header does not return with `text/plain` we assume it is also an
invalid robots.txt.

We will have a difficult time using robotparser straight from Python's
standard library. The module does not return the content of robots.txt.
Subclassing the module may be trick as implementing based on its
""already-parse"" content is useless. I also want to give a try to
implement a real robots.txt parser according to Google's document
outlined in [1]. I believe the first version could just follow the
recommendation based on [2] and [3].

Currently robots plugin does not actually verify the
existence of robots.txt. If the target url is 200-reacable, plugin
will return success. This is address by ticket #36.

Ticket #11 addresses the lack of validator in plugin. We should verify
the robots.txt is valid and is confronting to the standard.

We probably will adaopt the recommendations from the official
Robots.org, in addition to w3c.

case-insensitive when it comes to checking the value of the header. This
is related to ticket #28 and shall be discussed.

Lastly, we also added a function to kill ports (1234, 1235, 1443) in

This method was originally implemented in minion-zap-plugin. But we have
found this method is useful in many plugins and thus we have refactored
this method out of the zap plugin and is now part of the base class,
which is the base class that ExternalProcessPlugin and BlockingPlugin
are based on.

In additional to the original implementation, we now allow
developer to supply ``std_port`` dictionary, if the developer
needs to determine more ports. Note using ``urlparse`` can only
read standard url strings. We currently only help determine
the port by http and https as either 80 or 443, respectively.
Some sites still use ``8080`` as the port for http and some
chooses different port for https.",Yeuk Hon Wong,2013-07-18T16:15:03Z,Yeuk Hon Wong,Yeuk Hon Wong,35,34,1

This is a major patch.

First, there is a base class called Resource which is used to
create ""shortcut"" class to each of the backend's resource endpoint.
While it may be silly to create such class, as a test writer I find
this approach cleaner, more readable and easier to maintain than
the previous function-style.

Compare:

user = User(""bob@example.org"")
res = user.create()

to

res = self.create_user(""bob@eample.org"")

The class actually keeps certain ""states"" (at the attribute level).
Most of the classes have the same number of methods to access:

    create, get, update, delete

Secondly, when we actually test scan, we no longer run basics plugin,
which would require a mini Flask server to be running. Instead,
I am making use of DelayPlugin from tests plugin. However, this test
is turned off due to bug #296 (and #300). Until we fix those two,
that test will be commented out.

Third, test_key method is gone. When we want to check whether
the response contains keys we are expecting to have, we fall back
to the native self.assertEqual. We basically do this:

    self.assertEqual(set(key1),  set(key2))

where key1 and key2 are the set of keys we want to compare. While
doing this, I discovered that the original self._test_key method
contains a bug. We have added new keys to many responses but _test_key
did not catch the changes. With this new, more native approach,
I am able to detect the missing keys and this improve the realibitly of
our tests.

There are other changes, but in general this patch makes the tests
more robuts and easier to maintain.",Yeuk Hon Wong,2014-02-07T09:47:31Z,yeukhon,yeukhon,2826,1348,1478

Sumamary:

This final patch abstract common codes into base.py. The code should be
much cleaner to read.

+test_robots.py

test_robots.py is one that doesn't use the /test endpoint. It launches three
instances of Flask servers because to test the plugin we need a server that runs
with valid robots.txt, one with invalid robots.txt and one without robots.txt.

+ test_hsts.py

test_hsts.py test still rely on external sites (mozillalabs.com and google.com) to
test the existence and absence of HSTS header. We can't launch a local HTTPS server
because minion.curly.get will do certificate check. I need to speak with stefan about
allowing curly to receive an option to enable or disable verification on each call.

- cold boot

If we try to run multiple test files together there will be failure. This seems to be
race condition, the fact that some servers have not been terminated. This is a regression.
One way to solve this is to provide a test runner script that invoke individual test file.
I will file another bug to look at this issue but for now I know each file runs perfectly
fine.",Yeuk Hon Wong,2014-01-21T05:06:52Z,yeukhon,yeukhon,639,91,548

This snippet (http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/111/)
can be used to start Flask with TLS. A new directory called https_data
has been added to replace stunnel-data. The new direcorty contains
a testing certificate and a testing private key. There is a REAMDE
with instruction to generate the cert and key.

Unfortunately, because we self-signed the cert, we need to disable SSL/TLS
cert verification in pycurl. But I don't want to enable that until I have
spoken to Stefan about this. For now, we know the code works because the plugin
hasn't changed a bit. We will leave it commented out. I really hope we don't

What has changed?

+ tests are completly rewritten.
+ CSPPlugin is completely rewritten to support 1.0 syntax.
+ Compare to the previous CSSPlugin, CSP and XCSP presence check is always required.

The orginal rewrite expected more issues to raise, but I have given up that idea, Instead,
only relevant and basic syntax checks are done. Issues/summaries like how many directives
inherit from default-src are not available (although they were implemented I backed out those
codes during squash). Also, this plugin currently only checks the syntax of the CSP header; so
XCSP, CSP-RO and XCSP-RO are not verified. An experimental CSPPlugin (but separate) should
be developed. Until then this plugin can remain simple like this.",Yeuk Hon Wong,2014-01-13T18:28:18Z,yeukhon,yeukhon,800,504,296

This is my last pull request as an intern on the Mozilla Security
Assurance team.

What hasn't been implemented is the abililty to resolve the target
to the IP addres within the scan.

This is due to time constraint; I need more time
to develop a test case (maybe I overthink, maybe just localhost
is a fine test case, maybe). It is relatively very easy to add that
check anyway. I already have the resolver function implemented
in utils.py

The changes are to allow a ""scna.json"". We will extend the network
access before saving the target url to database in the future
commits.

The test includes two sample JSON. One with both blacklist and whitelist
empted and one with a blacklist. We are using ipaddress to determine
whether or not an ip is part of a whitelist (remind: anything
not in blacklist is automatically consider whitelisted).

I also want to be able to specify ports in the future (whitelist
a particular port on 192.168.1.1)).

We can do this once this implemented is accepted.

Anyway. I have had a great time at Mozilla. See you on #websectools.
