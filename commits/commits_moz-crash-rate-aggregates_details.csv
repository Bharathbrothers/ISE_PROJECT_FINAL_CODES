* Ignored and processed count for main and crash pings.
* Remove port bind in Vagrant so we don't take up a port we're not using - we don't need 5432 anymore since we moved away from Postgresql.
* Certain days have very small numbers of corrupted pings (<20 by my estimate). This causes errors on days like April 9. With these fixes in place, we either reject or handle these pings without stopping the job.",Roberto Agostino Vitillo,2016-04-14T10:21:20Z,vitillo,vitillo,69,50,19

18,moz-crash-rate-aggregates,bd9a1929cbad512983d55bc165600f57e61d8768,"Implement aggregator service to upload crash aggregates as Parquet to S3.

This service is meant to be run daily, to aggregate crash pings and crash stats from main pings into an easily queryable format.

The resulting Parquet files are uploaded to S3, and a different machine runs parquet2hive to import them daily into Presto.

Data stored in Presto can then be queried via re:dash, which is available at [1].
