This makes the graph lines and the graph data points line up. This only

When elasticsearch returns histogram data with a period of 1 day (like
we are doing on the histogram) the timestamps it returns have the hours
of a UTC midnight date, regardless of what timezone the aggregate set
represents.

This means that when the server is working in Pacific time, it
aggregates a Pacific day worth of data, sums it up, and then returns it
labeled with a timestamp. This timestamp, when output, is the midnight
of a UTC day (calculating the hours past midnight only returns 0 if you
assume UTC), even if localtime on the server is Pacific.

Even if we change to forcing a particular timezone in the future, this
will still be true, and elasticwill still label this data with UTC,

I didn't like the way this was originally implemented. It split routing
logic into several functions, and it seemed inelegant to me. This change
makes the special case of handling Firefox for Android's old feedback

all the routing logic back into a single function.

To handle the CSRF problem, the routing view is now csrf_exempt, and
each individual prodchan view is marked as csrf_project, except for
FfA's specific view.
