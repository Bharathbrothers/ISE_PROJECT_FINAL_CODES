As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

We can hack the date but then it would look like the challenge is closing a day later and again lead to confusion.

SO - as a short-term hack I've provided a waffle switch (use_hacked_PST) that will subtract 8 hours from the current end_date. This means we can set the challenge end_date to be April 6th, 07:59 GMT but have it display as closing at April 5th 11:59 - which is what the PST users would be expecting.

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

2021,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/186,186,Fix broken glean ping tests,"Tests were broken via https://github.com/mozilla/probe-scraper/pull/285 (in particular [the removal of the glean app](https://github.com/mozilla/probe-scraper/pull/285/files#diff-a039c9b63812e8c69d4ad7a53ccb7c5b15f3721aadca48e869ca5653fa7b4229L38-L51)). This also caused related issues filed in https://github.com/mozilla/probe-scraper/issues/293.

While schema generation itself was fine, this broke some of the existing tests that relied on the `glean` application name. This is blocking automatic deploys to dockerhub (e.g. #185).

```
E           requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://probeinfo.telemetry.mozilla.org/glean/glean/pings?t=2021-03-23T18:05:21.174148

This points the default library to `glean-core` and updates the tests appropriately. 

See https://github.com/mozilla-services/mozilla-pipeline-schemas/commit/35b792efc81ab948469c2b043e38d539bc4e736d for a commit while debugging this test failure, which ran without incompatible issues.

2079,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This generates a flat folder with BigQuery schemas in them. It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,3f66665ac1b0e88967f78d8951fe09e9c68ca596,Move logic into a generate function
2080,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This generates a flat folder with BigQuery schemas in them. It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,a2759e7c613c60789d9da302a1644b19e07d00d4,Refactor assumptions about current directory and format long commands
2081,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This generates a flat folder with BigQuery schemas in them. It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,290bd65f1555bfb42d8991b7710119b7bf6d3895,Add commands for generating diffs between schemas
2082,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This generates a flat folder with BigQuery schemas in them. It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,f8d67ac071c45babad40d520f14f47154f492d73,Refactor schema_generator scripts for reusability
2083,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This generates a flat folder with BigQuery schemas in them. It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,4f0ee1519d5e51ca0e9d5c9939286714d524256c,Fix script for successful push; add call to realpath breaking mac compat
2084,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

2085,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This generates a flat folder with BigQuery schemas in them. It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,cf5242c50243a5c109331e0c44eb94badb981e4d,Update formatting of diffs

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This generates a flat folder with BigQuery schemas in them. It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,e6c9694ea69004b1750d30cfec3e1912c9097aed,Move validation logic into main script
2089,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

2090,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This generates a flat folder with BigQuery schemas in them. It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,f94dcf76eb75a6afb1d3339da56e82650b075d80,Move validate_bigquery script into schema generator
2091,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This generates a flat folder with BigQuery schemas in them. It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,0b08db35decb63f3bfbee0422acc74dd28588623,Add mozilla-pipeline-schemas submodule for testing
2092,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

2093,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This generates a flat folder with BigQuery schemas in them. It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,422c48b5dc7a78e24ee8b5e8afcc255d429bc094,Add tests for validate_bigquery
2094,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This generates a flat folder with BigQuery schemas in them. It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,2a3f52cd65d2e0b080e6dfadb23ac3a52630e17b,Update main script for validate-bigquery local-validation
2095,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,97224fbeb4bf7b35f727f2323e25216543f6cbc5,Pull submodule for testing
2096,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

It should be possible to apply schemas between two revisions to an dataset too.",acmiyaguchi,3304040,2020-10-02T00:15:27Z,COLLABORATOR,True,624,119,11,A library for creating full representations of Mozilla telemetry pings.,Python,dec3629355b30d1a431a02d8ad74e2ebde4ce9ce,Add directions for initializing submodule for tests
2098,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

2099,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

2100,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

2101,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

2102,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/156,156,Bug 1666608 - Check for schema incompatibilities before pushing,"[bug link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666608)

This also fixes #74.

This adds an extra validation step before pushing schemas to `generated-schemas`. The basis of this is to generate a compact set of columns on the generated BigQuery schemas to determine if any columns are removed. This also refactors the main script for reusable components while developing this.

My testing workflow so far is something like this:

```bash
docker-compose run -v $PWD:/app/mozilla-schema-generator --entrypoint /bin/bash app
source mozilla-schema-generator/bin/schema_generator.sh
# -e causes the container to exit immediately
set +e
setup_git
setup_mps
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master
mozilla-schema-generator/bin/test_validate master~5
```

The `test_validate` runs the following command with some output:

2115,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pulls/153,153,"Clarifying commentary, esp. around how aliases work","I mistakenly filed https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pull/150 due to a misconception about how schema aliasing worked. Until this point, I hadn't fully understood that the modifications we make to JSON schemas are
mostly thrown out before committing changes.

This PR mostly just adds commentary, but does change internal behavior by copying around only BQ schemas when aliasing, making it more clear that aliasing has no effect on the JSON schemas committed to the published branch.

Before this change, the logs show:

```
Aliasing telemetry/main/main.4.bq to telemetry/saved-session/saved-session.4.bq
Aliasing telemetry/main/main.4.schema.json to telemetry/saved-session/saved-session.4.schema.json
Aliasing telemetry/main/main.4.bq to telemetry/first-shutdown/first-shutdown.4.bq
Aliasing telemetry/main/main.4.schema.json to telemetry/first-shutdown/first-shutdown.4.schema.json

I mistakenly filed https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-schema-generator/pull/150
due to a misconception about how schema aliasing worked. Until this point,
I hadn't fully understood that the modifications we make to JSON schemas are
mostly thrown out before committing changes.

This PR mostly just adds commentary, but does change internal behavior by
copying around only BQ schemas when aliasing, making it more clear that aliasing
has no effect on the JSON schemas committed to the published branch."

There are some quirks around how we handle git management within the container that I think are undesirable. First, every run of `schema_generator.sh` will clobber/delete the state of the previous run, which requires typing in the password for your ssh key to push to the repo. There are also protected files in the checked out repo that will require user prompting in the script. One idea is to prepopulate this repo with a submodule pointing to mozilla-pipeline-schemas, like mozilla-services/edge-validator, or to modifying the `setup_git_ssh` and `clone_and_configure_mps` functions so they can be run without throwing away all the initialization. This would make it easier to generate diffs between versions of the repo or revisions of mps. 

Additionally, we might want to think about adding tags to the master branch that correspond to a generated schema.

There are some quirks around how we handle git management within the container that I think are undesirable. First, every run of `schema_generator.sh` will clobber/delete the state of the previous run, which requires typing in the password for your ssh key to push to the repo. There are also protected files in the checked out repo that will require user prompting in the script. One idea is to prepopulate this repo with a submodule pointing to mozilla-pipeline-schemas, like mozilla-services/edge-validator, or to modifying the `setup_git_ssh` and `clone_and_configure_mps` functions so they can be run without throwing away all the initialization. This would make it easier to generate diffs between versions of the repo or revisions of mps. 

Additionally, we might want to think about adding tags to the master branch that correspond to a generated schema.

This also includes a validation schema for the aliasing file,
and tests that the file is valid.

So after I set up my env by `python setup.py ` and `run tox`, I got this error https://pastebin.mozilla.org/9031957. It seems like the tox require treeherder-client 2.0.1 but the latest number is 4.0.0. I'm not sure if it's a bug, but after I change the version number to 4.0.0, everything works well.

Please close this pr if I misunderstand something.  Thank you.

The added lines in `test/helpers.py` was just to get `tox` to pass locally. I assume some lint library was updated at some point or something.

As before, this argument can be omitted to default to production Treeherder.

Whilst treeherder-client 3.0.0 supports the old style arguments, they're deprecated.

In `TreeherderApi` I've stuck with the same argument name as used in `TreeherderClient` for greater consistency. In addition, calling `TreeherderApi(treeherder_server_url='foo')` feels a little redundant, since the class is only for Treeherder, so it's already clear about what `server_url` is referring.

- Move mozci/sources/tc into mozci/taskcluster/tc.py
- It adds mozci/taskcluster/**init**.py to simplify import calls
- It moves taskcluster related tests and mocks under test/taskcluster
- It removes storing repositories in disk
- It fixes some intermittent issues in test_repository.py due to improper mocking

First thanking you,mikeling,jmaher and all other guys who have encouraged me to contribute.
the change involves just adding try-catch blocks around the main() function in two files trigger.py and buildbot_to_taskcluster.py 

i am unable to test it on my system right now ,but mikeling has for buildbot_to_taskcluster.py .  I assume the same for trigger.py

When running automated backfilling, it is hard to go through so much
output.
In this patch, we do a bit of code clean up plus adjusting the logging
levels.

We also add the ability to disable validation of buildernames and
revisions
since we can safely assume that Treeherder can only send valid revisions
and buildernames to pulse_actions.

We also add the ability to disable the progress bar when downloading
files over the network. This is important as papertrail's logging
gets ugly because of it.

We also remove inspecting for a good job to double of revisions of
max_revisions.
This is important as we can slow down the processing and we are likely
wasting our time."

Fixing this revealed another bug: the file was corrupted 100% of the time because it was opened in text mode when writing and reading, which converts \n bytes to \r\n on Windows.

The error message was so weird because there was another bug in the code: we were assuming that we would get a subprocess.CalledProcessError when gzip is not installed on the system but we actually get a OSError.

2768,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools/pulls/174,174,Fixing PR 169,"Turns out that only looking at the platform name does not tell us if a build is debug or not (test jobs do not have -debug in their 'platform' field, only build jobs do):

I fixed this by checking if ' debug ' is in the buildername. I believe that debug test jobs always have 'debug' in their names. Now we have:
