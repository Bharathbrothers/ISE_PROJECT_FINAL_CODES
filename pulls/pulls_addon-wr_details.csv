As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

37,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/addon-wr/pulls/18,18,Use ports to avoid race condition,"There was, with using normal browser.runtime.onMessage/sendMessage, a race condition where the content script would sometimes load before the background script on extension startup and try to send it a message before its message listener had been added.

Using a port between the content script and background script eliminates this problem, as the content script is notified when it is connected with the background script and can then send and receive messages.

I also looked at the tooltip on several popular websites and added some neutralizing styles (and cleaned up the CSS block in background.js).

There was, with using normal browser.runtime.onMessage/sendMessage, a race condition where the content script would sometimes load before the background script on extension startup and try to send it a message before its message listener had been added.

42,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/addon-wr/pulls/12,12,WIP - Add hover effect. Closes #9.,"![mrrobotpageeffect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17437436/33701069-c78ec0bc-dad1-11e7-9f36-5c46e57e624e.gif)

I discovered why we were seeing multiple ""span"" elements wrapped around the same matching word -- we were looking for ""div"" and ""p"" elements to check, and frequently, a ""div"" would have nested ""div""s and ""p""s, so if a word was in one of the nested elements, it'd get wrapped multiple times. I have changed the `querySelectorAll` to look for ""p"", ""h1"", ""h2"" and ""h3"" now, which are not commonly nested within each other. A quick check on the Mozilla privacy page showed they are never nested within each other for that page.

Loose ends:
* There is currently a race condition with addon start-up between the background script and content scripts being loaded into existing tabs. The content script immediately sends a message to the background script to get the word list, sometimes before it is listening, throwing an error. Currently, this means some of the time on ""web-ext run"", the content script executes correctly, and sometimes it throws and does nothing. This seems like a chicken and egg problem to me, so I would appreciate ideas.
* The page linked on the hover effect tooltip element currently opens in a new window, rather than a new tab. This is unusual behavior, since I am using an ""a"" element with target=""_blank"". Do we care?
* While the fix above for multiple wrapped ""span"" elements should help some with the performance issue (""this addon is slowing down Firefox""), we should check to see if we are still receiving the warning.
* The CSS for the hover effect adds quite a bit of CSS. Currently the position of the tooltip is to the right of the word, but there are styles in case we'd like to try ""left"", ""bottom"" and ""top"". Perhaps we should consider moving it to an external stylesheet now?",biancadanforth,17437436,2017-12-07T06:03:08Z,COLLABORATOR,True,120,8,2,Looking Glass is a collaboration between Mozilla and the makers of Mr. Robot to provide a shared world experience. ,JavaScript,611590dcbb6e80f29e7d40d1d2f70e236c6da1ea,"Add hover effect.
