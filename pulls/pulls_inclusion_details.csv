As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

### Github Survey Data Analysis
https://github.com/avneet14027/Github-Survey-analysis/blob/master/SurveyAnalysis.md <br>
This is a contribution towards Diversity and Inclusion Issue - Visualization Of Github Data. The main goal is here to analyze various factors affecting an individuals contribution to open source. The entire analysis was done in R and is accessible in the form of a markdown file with all the plots included in it. Also, R code has been provided in a separate file within the same repository. Interesting observations came out from this data, the likeliness of men vs women and non binary genders , towards contributing to open source, being employed full time is enormous as compared to the other gender categories. Moreover, an analysis on the various types of contributions and participations have also been done. 
This was also a way for learning R for me through interesting data analysis. 
A variety of visualization techniques like grouped bar charts, simple bar chart, chord diagram, heat-maps etc. were explored for the same.

Towards showcasing skills in R programming language - Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis
Source of data: https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey
Programming Language: R
Tools: RStudio
The young people survey is a dataset released by Kaggle about hobbies, interests, certain demographic factors, educational qualification of todays youth, movie and music preferences, personal feelings, personal choices on life struggles, happiness index etc. The goal of this analysis is to ponder upon the nature of today's youth who are going to be leaders of tomorrow. Also, the reason I chose this dataset is to know the general trend among todays youth in terms of music and movie preferences and analyzing social quality of life based on personal factors and decisions. Also, this dataset gives us an insight into the gender gaps as well as gaps in urban and rural life within various aspects of life that need to be contemplated upon.
