It looks to be caused by overlapping watches from gulp + nunjucks. The dev.html -> index.html is watched + built here https://github.com/mozilla/marketplace-gulp/blob/master/index.js#L387 a new nunjucks env causes the templates to be watched by nunjucks by default.

Doing this seems to also benefits non-docker usage as I see the node CPU usage drop from ~20% to ~4%.
