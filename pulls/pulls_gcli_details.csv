Previously we managed alternate implementations using loader tricks
but this was getting increasingly messy, so now we're going to do it
using a git branch. This means quite a bit of moving files around, but
no substantive changes.

As far as the GCLI/master branch goes, it means that we can delete all
the mozilla specific files. This is the first commit to the mozmaster
branch which moves those mozilla specific files over their main branch
versions, and removes all the files that were not relevant to mozilla.

We add getArgsObject to ExecutionContext (the exposed version of a
Requisition) and then pass that around to all type functions so they
can make decisions about type operations that depend on the current
state of the command line.

Some examples of where this could be useful:
- The max line number depends on the filename
- The type of a setting value depends on the setting

Sharing a commandOutputManager wasn't the common case, and it caused
confusion, so we make the default to be one commandOutputManager per
requisition, and allow configuration to share them.

This means that Requisition adds a 3rd parameter (a custom COM) which
defaults to a new COM if null. This is then used by tests and Display
implementations to configure a COM. Focus and OutputTerminal then use
the COM in their Requisition rather than having an explicit COM of
their own.
