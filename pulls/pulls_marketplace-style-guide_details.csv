0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/marketplace-style-guide/pulls/14,14,Use marketplace-core-css.,"This required two changes to other repositories, as we currently can not pass configuration to Stylus:
- https://github.com/mozilla/commonplace/pull/63 added default configuration, which included an automatic inclusion of core-css in CSS builds.
- https://github.com/mozilla/marketplace-gulp/pull/23 used the configuration from each project's config file, which augments the default config.

3,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/marketplace-style-guide/pulls/11,11,Implement new navigation.,"This is getting close to ready for a full review. Open to any feedback now, @pwalm @ngokevin @mstriemer 

Some screencasts:
- [Behavior on mobile](http://chuck.mn/3R2w0W3c2g39)
- [Behavior on desktop](http://chuck.mn/2V3J443i0I3t)
- [Transitions](http://chuck.mn/0z3p1W292D2H)
### TODO:
- [x] Having a little bit of trouble maintaining state on desktop.
- [x] Investigate possibility of animated transitions on desktop. This is unlikely due to how we maintain state between desktop and mobile.
- [x] Just use jQuery. I tried to skip it, but the code would be cleaner and clearer with it.
- [x] Use variables for colors.
- [x] Clean up SVGs.
