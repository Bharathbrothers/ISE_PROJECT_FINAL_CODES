0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/kanbanzilla/pulls/15,15,Get some unit tests running again,"This works by adding explicit dependencies for a bunch of stuff into karma.conf.js so that it actually gets loaded. This takes us from 21/21 tests failing to 17/21 failing.

So, forward progress.  There is probably a better fix for this that avoids duplicating test config data, but just getting the unit tests running at all seems like a higher priority.

Also removed the karma-e2e.conf.js file, since it's unused and as such just serves to confuse new developers.

If you don't like having all the npm deps on one line, I would still recommend putting them in a code block instead of inlines, so they don't all end up on one line in the rendered view.
