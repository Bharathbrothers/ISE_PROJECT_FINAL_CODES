This is due to the time between package creation and indexing by the search job being dependent upon a queue. Sometimes it can be <10 seconds but other time it can be up to 60 seconds or more. Devs and I considered this was still reasonable UX performance but adding a 60 second sleep into the test was not acceptable as it would lock out the grid node.

Stephen and I did not want to lose or xfail this test coverage as we consider it valuable. This solution is to repeat the search until the timeout value is reached.

I have used dynamic time loop to account for the implicit waits in Webdriver and make sure the timeout limit is adhered to properly.
