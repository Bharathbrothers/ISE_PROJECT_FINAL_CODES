It parses the PR log for several MDN projects, to find the merged PRs for the previous month, and which are from first-time contributors. It uses this data to create a template for the monthly Kuma report, and prints it to stdout.

Add a Python script to generate the template for the monthly Kuma
report. This uses:

* requests (popular HTTP requests library)
* requests-cache (persistent cache for requests)
* Credentials for a GitHub OAuth app, created by the user

It parses the PR log for several MDN projects, to find the merged PRs
for the previous month, and which are from first-time contributors. It
uses this data to create a template for the monthly Kuma report, and
prints it to stdout."

Also, if anyone would rather not have their job titles listed so formally, we could totally go with some comedy ones (like people use on phonebook?). Any typos or errors or other suggestions please let me know. If people would like their name linked to any personal blog / bio / profile please specify.
