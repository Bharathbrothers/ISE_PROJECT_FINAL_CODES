1,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/community.openbadges.org/pulls/5,5,Closes #4. Increase text-indent for smaller viewports.,"Not actually sure where you guys want the change, but I changed it in `core.css`, `core.min.css` (which isn't used in production?) and `core.less` (assuming there's some build process behind the scenes).

And it looks like my editor squashed some stray whitespace, if that's an issue let me know and I can revert those changes.
