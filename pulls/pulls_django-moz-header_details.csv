When jingo-minify compiles the CSS, it's served out of /media/css, while the relative paths in unified assume they're being served out of a directory adjacent to the image directory. Changing the paths makes local development difficult, because jingo-minify doesn't compile when DEV = True.

The default style handles this by putting its css at the root of the repo, so that using '../global' will reference the same directory whether the CSS is served out of /media/css or /media/global. 

This pull request removes the default theme and adds in unified. DO NOT AUTO-MERGE. When approved, I'll merge this as a new branch rather than merging into master (github doesn't let me create a new branch in a pull request).
