This patch removes the filesystem instance caching, and always creates new instances.  I've also streamlined the call signature for `filesystem.create()` so it doesn't require deep knowledge of how providers work.

There were some tests failing, which were looking for `fs.name`, `fs.watch` and these are not necessary.  I've removed them.

I've also fixed some code style and added some basic logging.

This adds a `ClientInfo` module that tracks client info by client id, and deals with extracting data about browser/device, how many times we've synced, how long the last sync took, etc.

Later we should probably refactor this a bit to add `SyncInfo` that can track more detailed info about a sync (number of files, size of files, ...).

`no_ready_check:` defaults to false. When a connection is established to the Redis server, the server might still be loading the database from disk. While loading, the server not respond to any commands. To work around this, node_redis has a ""ready check"" which sends the INFO command to the server. The response from the INFO command indicates whether the server is ready for more commands. When ready, node_redis emits a ready event.

This is actually a trouble when deploying to heroku where we are doing some development on Webmaker app.

131,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/makedrive/pulls/249,249,Fix #233: Refactor server logic for websockets and sync,"This patch does a number of things, mostly aimed at being more careful about error states, and not causing, or avoiding, crashes.

A few things to note:
- I've moved away from `on('event')` to `onevent` so that I can safely manage a single listener at all times.  This makes it easier to reason about what is going to get triggered when.
- I've moved to always using `data.data` for `onmessage(data, flags)` since node also requires it.  We should confirm this works OK when the client is a browser.
- I've added more cases where we send back error SyncMessages to the client when things go wrong (e.g., invalid data)
- I've stopped using `socket.send` everywhere, and instead introduced `sync.sendMessage` which manages access to the ws instance, and makes sure we don't throw.  If we do, I emit an error so that we can deal with it (i.e., we shutdown the client cleanly now vs. crashing)
- I've added logic for dealing with the wss (server) erroring, where we now try to restart it, and if we can't, we bring down the server safely.
- I've added some new Sync states to reflect errors and the sync being terminated.
- I've streamlined a few users of `updateLastContact` since we were calling it multiple times in the same code path, which isn't necessary.

I've made various other code improvements as well, but the diff will show those better.  I spent a bunch of time reading https://github.com/einaros/ws/blob/master/lib/WebSocket.js and https://github.com/einaros/ws/blob/master/lib/WebSocketServer.js closely to make sure we are following what it actually does in terms of errors, states, events, etc.

- make MakeDrive client useable in node.js (with memory provider, and by swapping WebSocket/ws via browserify).
- add a way to turn off auto-sync'ing in the MakeDrive client, such that we can control when it happens in tests.

The test itself uses our authentication utils, gets a token, then sets up a MakeDrive fs instance, wires all the various listeners, writes a file, then tries to sync.  If all goes well, it moves through the various states, checking as it goes.

I'd like to write more tests, but it's currently not possible, since running this test after our other WebSocket tests, or writing more than one test like this (you can copy/paste it to see what I mean) will fail with `[Error: Current sync in progress! Try again later!]`.  This is hard to make sense of, since I'm using a different username (i.e., generated with a uuid), so nothing should be locked.  We need to solve that before I can move forward.
