1. We don't have pytest fixtures, so we are creating the account in each test.
2. This code was still using fxapom 1.2, so it was still using the `base_url` so that needed to be changed as well.

As with the other PR, this needs to wait for fxapom 1.4 to be released, and I'll wait on that until you've had a chance to look over this PR as well.

`fxapom` was also to pick up a new version of `PyFxA`, so this project needs to be updated to pick up the new `fxapom`. I think it makes sense to unpin `fxapom` as only this project and marketplace-tests (desktop tests) use it, and we are in full control of all 3 projects.

35,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/marketplace-tests-gaia/pulls/92,92,Experiment with fixing the PIN continue button issue,"As per our discussion in IRC, @davehunt, I tried to implement a similar solution to the one we used for Login for the fact that we often fail to click on the PIN ""Continue"" or ""Submit"" button after entering the PIN. 

As you will see in the attached diff, I removed the previous code which did:
`Wait(marionette=self.marionette).until(lambda m: button.is_enabled())`

and replaced it with a sequence that waits for the element to be present, then displayed, then enabled, and then scrolls it into view.

When I did that, without the sleep at line 87, it _never_ works. The tap _always_ fails, whereas with the old code it only fails sometimes. With the added sleep it always seems to work.

This suggests to me that the old code was taking a bit longer to execute than the new code, which is why it worked sometimes. It was like a sleep. I am a bit surprised that the old code takes longer to execute than the new code, as it's essentially doing the same thing (it's doing even less, in fact), but I guess the way each method is implemented in Marionette is different.

So right now the only working solution I have is the `sleep`. Do you have any other suggestions for better things to do/wait for in this case?

I also took this opportunity to do a bit of refactoring with the Marketplace app name, which was unnecessarily being set all over the place. It can still be overridden in an individual test, but doesn't need to be set for every test.

Tbh, this is probably a better approach than PR #10, unless there is a specific reason that we'd rather not launch the app via the icon.

This is a non-critical JS exception, but it causes the test to fail.

A sample stack trace is:

We saw something similar in the gaia-ui-tests job awhile back and had to wait for a developer to address it.

Because this repo is small and focussed on testing Marketplace functionality, as opposed to general gaia reliability, it was suggested that maybe we should just ignore these errors. I believe that Bebe proposed a similar approach at the time and it wasn't favoured, but I discussed this with Zac on IRC and we thought it might be appropriate for this repo.

Hence, I bring you this pull request. It is a bit ugly as I had to override the launch method in `GaiaApps`, but the plus side is that, if we do decide to accept this patch, we now have a template going forward for any other times we need to customize the behaviour of gaiatest for this repo.

I'm not convinced that this is the best approach, and I'm going to try something simpler as well, and probably submit that as a second PR, so I am interested in people's feedback on this.

Pinging @zacc @davehunt @bebef1987 for feedback.
