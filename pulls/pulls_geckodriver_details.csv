As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

If we can get this fixed we only have to figure out why the job initially hangs for Windows 64:

Everything else seems to work including the build of the win32 binary.

VERBOSE (TEST) DETAILS:

OS: Ubuntu (i686 (32-bit))
selenium-webdriver (3.4.0)
Browser: Firefox (53.0 (32-bit))
geckodriver (0.14.0)

As of this commit:
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases does not provide a link for a 32-bit linux release of the current 0.16.0 or older 0.15.0 builds.

0.14.0 is the last version of geckodriver that has had a successful release build, as seen here:
https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/geckodriver/builds

There seems to be a bug with geckodriver 0.14.0 sending marionette a null sessionId on initial connection, i.e:
capabilities:{“sessionId”:null } and/or possibly mishandling the valid sessionId to/from the webdriver.

Environment: running headless via selenium-webdriver, Xfvb, and firefox

The following error can be seen in debug mode while using geckodriver:
/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.4.0/gems/selenium-webdriver-3.4.0/lib/selenium/webdriver/remote/w3c_bridge.rb:118:in `create_session': no sessionId in returned payload (Selenium::WebDriver::Error::WebDriverError)

The following errors can be seen when compiling geckodriver 0.16.0 with backtrace-sys 0.1.6 and 0.1.10:

Quick fix notes for a successful 0.16.0 release build on 32-bit linux:
* Tested changes:
1) downgraded backtrace-sys from 0.1.10 to 0.1.5 with a successful release build
2) tested with backtrace-sys 0.1.6 without success and with same failure as 0.1.10

notes:
a) It can be deduced that the bug was introduced in changes made in backtrace-sys 0.1.6.
b) I left gcc 0.3.45 and libc 0.2.21 (backtrace-sys deps) as they were in geckodriver 0.16.0.
c) geckodriver 0.14.0 (uses backtrace-sys 0.1.5) and used gcc 0.3.42 and libc 0.2.20 as deps.

backtrace 0.3.0 and backtrace-sys 0.1.5 introduced here (Jan 30):
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/commit/6c161a2fe3cff818bcb5cf30cee92256229926de

backtrace-sys changed from 0.1.5 to 0.1.10 here (Feb 24):
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/commit/09231df3527c0c37f2cc2210072683d6d8cbdbf5

81,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/geckodriver/pulls/593,593,Update required Selenium version to 3.3.1,"Hi,
in recent days we get a few bugreports in [facebook/php-webdriver](https://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver) project from people trying to use Selenium 3.3.0 with latest geckodriver (like https://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver/issues/432 and https://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver/issues/434). However version 3.3.0 of Selenium is affected with some incompatibilities (eg. https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/3632), so I suggest clearly recommending version 3.3.1+.

the Flash plugin to be disabled by default.  The Firefox homepage triggers

Since Flash cannot be interacted with through WebDriver and it is soon

Marionette server starts, unless marionette.prefs.recommended prevents
it, a set of preferences very similar to this list prior to these changes
are set.

The full list of recommended automation preferences can be seen in

believe are a requirement to set prior to starting up Firefox, i.e. those

The vendoring of Rust crates in mozilla-central is not yet perfect.
Due to the lack of cargo workspaces, it is hard/impossible, it is believed
that dependencies of dependencies are not correctly vendored when running
`./mach vendor rust`.

geckodriver's direct dependencies are vendored fine in mozilla-central,
but certain of the dependencies of our dependencies are not and cargo
ends up complaining about not matching the correct version from those
available in under third_party/rust.

By pinning certain of these dependencies to known-existing crate versions
in m-c, we can circumvent this problem.  This is obviously not ideal, but
it is a working stopgap until cargo support in m-c improves.  The upside
is that it allows us to build geckodriver on build slaves and as part
of the Firefox build."

When Firefox’ milestone from the last successful startup of the
browser is different to the actual milestone, it is assumed that an
upgrade has occurred.  This causes the browser to be redirected to the
homepage override URL.

Setting this preference to `ignore` will cause the redirect not to
happen on upgrade.  This is important in the case of Marionette because
it also seems to be used to open two tabs on launching Firefox with a
fresh profile.

This doesn’t quite fix #241, because there is still an underlying race
condition when starting Firefox with a homepage."

As this patch removes the env-logger crate, support for setting the

ways to request a log level is to use the `-vv` or `--log LEVEL` flags, or
the `firefoxOptions.log.level` capability as described in the README.md.

This patch also fixes a bug where the capability log level would
override the log level requested by flag in `MarionetteSettings`, causing
subsequent WebDriver sessions to inherit the log level.  For example,
if session 1 used `firefoxOptions.log.level` and session 2 did not,
it would reuse the level from before because `MarionetteSettings` would

I'm happy to just always set this in a profile capability if you'd rather users do it that way. I only suggest this because in the Java and Python client bindings (and probably others), if you construct a new FirefoxProfile(), it contains this pref by default, which means that the popup blocker is enabled if you omit the `firefox_profile` capability, but disabled if you pass a profile created with the default constructor and no further modifications.

(But perhaps that should just be the client's problem, in the end.)

195,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/geckodriver/pulls/164,164,Describe overloaded firefox_profile caps functionality,"I was surprised to read that `firefox_profile` accepted a path on the local filesystem in the README, instead of accepting the zipped, base64 directory like the old `.xpi` extension used to, and also how the remote driver treats the `firefox_profile` cap. So I checked and it does of course handle the [zipped base64 directory method](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/blob/da1bee2b2db981646730fccd09650f87b0cbf8fe/src/marionette.rs#L408). I thought it might be useful to indicate that the filesystem-path behavior overloads the cap, instead of replacing the zipped/b64 functionality.

But if this doesn't seem to confusing to y'all, feel free to reject. And, thanks for all the hard work on `geckodriver`!
