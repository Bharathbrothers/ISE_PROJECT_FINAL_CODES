> # This HISTORY log is deprecated
> 
> Please see [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/releases) for the current changelog.
> 
> # 4.1.0 (2018-12-26)
> 
>  * `.connect()` IP/DNS override option (Kornel)
>  * `.trustLocalhost()` option for allowing broken HTTPS on `localhost`
>  * `.abort()` used with promises rejects the promise.
> 
> # 4.0.0 (2018-11-17)
> 
> ## Breaking changes
> 
> * Node.js v4 has reached it's end of life, so we no longer support it. It's v6+ or later. We recommend Node.js 10.
> * We now use ES6 in the browser code, too.
>   * If you're using Browserify or Webpack to package code for Internet Explorer, you will also have to use Babel.
>   * The pre-built node_modules/superagent.js is still ES5-compatible.
> * `.end(…)` returns `undefined` instead of the request. If you need the request object after calling `.end()` (and you probably don't), save it in a variable and call `request.end(…)`. Consider not using `.end()` at all, and migrating to promises by calling `.then()` instead.
> * In Node, responses with unknown MIME type are buffered by default. To get old behavior, if you use custom _unbuffered_ parsers, add `.buffer(false)` to requests or set `superagent.buffer[yourMimeType] = false`.
> * Invalid uses of `.pipe()` throw.
> 
> 
> ## Minor changes
> 
> * Throw if `req.abort().end()` is called
> * Throw if using unsupported mix of send and field
> * Reject `.end()` promise on all error events (Kornel Lesiński)
> * Set `https.servername` from the `Host` header (Kornel Lesiński)
> * Leave backticks unencoded in query strings where possible (Ethan Resnick)
> * Update node-mime to 2.x (Alexey Kucherenko)
> * Allow default buffer settings based on response-type (shrey)
> * `response.buffered` is more accurate.
> 
> # 3.8.3 (2018-04-29)
> 
> * Add flags for 201 & 422 responses (Nikhil Fadnis)
> * Emit progress event while uploading Node `Buffer` via send method (Sergey Akhalkov)
> * Fixed setting correct cookies for redirects (Damien Clark)
> * Replace .catch with ['catch'] for IE9 Support (Miguel Stevens)
> 
> # 3.8.2 (2017-12-09)
> 
> * Fixed handling of exceptions thrown from callbacks
> * Stricter matching of `+json` MIME types.
> 
> # 3.8.1 (2017-11-08)
> 
> * Clear authorization header on cross-domain redirect

As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

248,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/2201,2201,quick fix to maker party tabs,"@gvn so Initially, I needed a tab navigation functionality, that looked like the clubs nav.

I didn't see the clubs nav working with routes, so I just did the quickest thing (we needed it on pontoon asap, so the link needed to function, not look good) which was just some `<Link>` elements and stole some css. Seemed to work fine, but was fragile.

Not surprisingly the events nav broke. I noticed there were some changes to the classNames in way mofo-ui tab switcher, which is fine, and I updated the classNames in my quick implementation, and that's all this PR is addressing. The Nav looks good again.

However, I did notice that the clubs page seems to be using routes in the nav somehow, and I think I need a more stable solution for my nav so it doesn't break again. Thoughts I have or ideas for a future patch would be:
1. Are you open to changes to the clubs nav UI to just be some css and some `<Link>` elements? Or is there something a little more complex going on in the `TabSwitcher` that prevents this?
2. I update my page to be more like clubs, but I'm actually confused as to how the `TabSwitcher` works.
3. Do nothing. Maybe you don't plan on updating the css in the `TabSwitcher`, but this is unlikely, and not a great option.
4. I freeze the css in another css file so if you make changes to `TabSwitcher` the maker party page stay the same. Also not a great option.

I like options 1 and 2 best. 3 and 4 are hacks. Thoughts?

Actual changes for this PR in commit https://github.com/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pull/2133/commits/77546fdf14954dea84dd7598278e99025f0acad3

This PR removes the most problematic bits around the whole static site content generation, but for the moment keeps the two separate webpack tasks:
1. `./config/webpack/webpack.client.config.js` is the client-side bundle, building from entry point `./lib/build/client.bundle.jsx`.
2. `./config/webpack/webpack.server.config.js` is roughly the same thing, but compiled as commonjs2 format from `./lib/build/server.library.jsx`, so that app.js can load it in and use it for static page generation (renamed from `indexStatic` to `serverBundle` in app.js)

The client builds to `./dist/client.bundle.js`, and the server to `./build/server.library.js`.

(I tried doing this as a unified task using a ""umd"" target library but there was no victory there. After an hour of trying the way towards a clean dev run involved keeping the two compiles but simply making it obvious when and why they're used)

The `npm start` task has been rewritten to run the normally-run-once tasks for LESS compilation and bundle generation into watched tasks, so that changes to js/jsx/less files automatically trigger rebuilds. For the webpack compile tasks, the start script simply passes the `--watch` flag so that webpack goes into file watch mode, and for LESS I added `chokidar` to monitor the entire `./less` directory for file changes.

Additionally, `app.js` got a chokidar watch instruction that kicks in when app.js does not run with node in production mode. This instruction centers around monitoring the `./dist/index-static` dir for changes to the server-side bundle. If that bundle is updated, it causes app.js to rebind the bundle, and then rebind the `router` it uses internally for generating page data, so that changes to the source code don't just generate the latest and greatest code client-side, but also server-side.

The following npm scripts should do the following things:
- `npm test` (runs linting and compiles, both of which may flag errors)
- `npm run launch` (runs the compiles sequentially, then starts the app.js server, currently meant as procfile instruction, to allow for prod-env-vars despite promoting a slug)
- `npm start` (runs the compiles and app.js server in parallel, and in watch mode for all the things)

Also note that linting uses `eslint` and is done as part of the client-side bundling. I considered putting it in the server-side bundle as well but that would have made no sense: you'd see the same error twice. There is still a separate `npm run lint:fix`, which runs eslint with the `--fix` flag, which is useful while we get the codebase in line with the mofo-style linting rules.

There is still a separate `npm run lint:fix`, which runs eslint with the `--fix` flag, which is useful while we get the codebase in line with the mofo-style linting rules.

570,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/1883,1883,Clubform,"Implements https://github.com/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/issues/1857, fixes https://github.com/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/issues/1884

learning site:
- [x] make ""mozilla clubs"" use the same purple nav colour
- [x] only allowed logged in users to fill in the application form.
- [x] implement the UI for ""when users are not logged in""
- [x] implement club form page 1
- [x] implement club form page 2
- [x] implement club form acknowledgement
- [x] implement club form send-to-teach-API functionality in line with current data
  - [x] implement club form send-to-teach-API functionality extended for the new form (*teach-api)
- [x] have the application form highlight as if we're on the mozilla clubs page in sidebar
- [x] rewrite ""apply"" buttons to point to new club form

teach-api:
- [x] update the club model to cover all the new fields from the application form

And once the PR is good to go:
- [x] remove login hardwire from the `teach-api.js` file (controlled by `emulateLogin`)
## follow up
- remove the old ""apply"" modal code from base clubs form  https://github.com/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/issues/2045
- update the tests to cover the new application form https://github.com/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/issues/2046
- determine whether we want localisation on the application form (since we have no staff able to review arbitrary language submissions right now) https://github.com/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/issues/2049
## test setup
- set up a local [id.wmo](https://github.com/mozilla/id.webmaker.org), [login.wmo](https://github.com/mozilla/login.webmaker.org), [teach-api](https://github.com/mozilla/teach-api) and [learn.moz](https://github.com/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org), with the latter set to this branch (`clubform`)
  - this might require setting up a working postgres instance for id.wmo, too... please see https://github.com/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/wiki#bootstrapping-idwebmakerorg for instructions
  - make sure to run the teach-api's `manage.py migrate` at least once, so that you're on the new form schema
  - create an `.env` file in the learn.moz root directory (if you don't already have one) and add `export TEACH_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` to that, so that the learning site uses your local copy of the teach-api
  - in teach-api, edit `./teach/settings.py`:

```
IDAPI_URL = os.environ.get('IDAPI_URL', 'http://localhost:1234')
IDAPI_CLIENT_ID = os.environ.get('IDAPI_CLIENT_ID', 'test')
IDAPI_CLIENT_SECRET = os.environ.get('IDAPI_CLIENT_SECRET', 'test')

LOGINAPI_URL = os.environ.get('LOGINAPI_URL', 'http://localhost:3000')
LOGINAPI_AUTH = os.environ.get('LOGINAPI_AUTH')

TEACH_SITE_URL = os.environ.get('TEACH_SITE_URL', 'http://localhost:8008')
```
## test steps
1. start all services
2. head over to http://localhost:8008/clubs
3. sign in (or if this is a clean install of id/login, sign up)
4. fill in the new application club form by going to [http://localhost:8008/en-US/clubs](http://localhost:8008/en-US/clubs) and clicking the ""apply to be a club captain"" button
   - there are two pages of fields; not filling in certain fields should prevent you from moving on to the next page/submitting, flagging fields in red with messages on what still needs to be done at the bottom of the page (try submitting page 1 and page 2 before filling anything in to confirm this)
5. submit club form with your console/network tab open in dev tools (in case things don't work!)
6. submitting should work and take you to a third screen informing you that you you submitted your application.
7. point a new tab to the teach-api admin view on [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) (if you get a login, please see https://github.com/mozilla/teach-api#making-a-staff-account-to-use-the-admin-route)
8. verify the club application exists
9. click the club name to see a detailed information view; verify it looks like what you filled in (it should)
10. point a new tab to [http://localhost:8008/clubs](http://localhost:8008/clubs), and scroll down to the map
11. verify your club shows up on the map

618,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/1830,1830,Badges,"Fixes a ton of issues, although there are still a few things left to clean up. This is a port on top of the most recent develop as of 19 april 2016, with some ""fixes"" to gulp as well, to get rid of the static file generation, and a fix to route matching so that pages with :params resolve correctly.

Ping me for instructions on how to test this, because it requires having teach-api running on the badges branch, too, which requires some mozilla Credly credentials.
### I had to remove spider testing

This build system is still _very_ weird and the spider task in combination with the static server (which doesn't even make sense anymore now that we don't static generate) would crash and burn trying to evaluate, because the static file build tasks got removed, because they _can't run_ for urls with parameters in them.

I'm not happy with that, but I don't see a way out here - a lot of this code seems to have been set up in the assumption that we'd never have dynamic routes, which is now hitting us hard.

Followup to reinstroduce this filed as https://github.com/mozilla/teach.mozilla.org/issues/1836
### How to test this PR

As this PR relies on the Teach-API, you will need a copy of that running, checked out to the ""badges"" branch. This also requires having a working login system set up, so here's how I have it running:
1. psql running in the background
2. login.webmaker.org running locally
3. id.webmaker.org running locally
4. teach-api running on the `badges` branch
5. teach.mozilla.org running on the `badges` branch

However, there is now also an heroku app instance of the teach api with the badges branch, so you can probably tell your local teach.mozilla.org to use [https://teach-api-with-credly-badges.herokuapp.com](https://teach-api-with-credly-badges.herokuapp.com) as the TEACH_API endpoint, and things _should_ work, with logins based on staging id.wmo
### Things to check
- Does the design look like the comps over on https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2irLVDJivhLOEIzWkZiM3c5ZVE/view
#### flow when not logged in
1. don't be logged in
2. navigate to the ""credentials"" section of the site
   - [x] do badges load?
   - [x] can you navigate to a badge page?
   - [x] are you prompted to sign in?
   - [x] does the sign in button work?
     - [x] lets you sign in
     - [x] redirects to the page you were on
3. on individual badge pages
   - [x] does the badge load?
   - [x] are you prompted to sign in?
   - [x] does the sign in button work?
     - [x] lets you sign in
     - [x] redirects to the page you were on
   - [x] there are prev/next navigation entries at the bottom of the page
     - [x] they actually load what they claim they do
#### flow when logged in, but not linked to credly

   - [x] does the badge load?
   - [x] are you prompted to link with credly?
   - [x] does the link button work?
     - [x] lets you fill in an email and password (I recommend testing with a filtering email address, so something like `mavis+test1@mofo` so we can easily wipe all test accounts when we're happy that it works)
     - [x] returns you to the page you were on, and reloads it
     - [x] reload shows you as logged in, and credly-linked
#### flow when logged in, and linked to credly
1. navigate to the ""credentials"" section of the site
   - [x] do badges load?
   - [ ] do badges indicate their earned status? (""elligible"", ""pending"", ""achieved"")
2. on individual badge pages
   - [x] does the badge load?
   - [ ] does it indicate the earned status? (""elligible"", ""pending"", ""achieved"")
   - [ ] do you get an application form?
     - [x] text area

**Changes proposed in this pull request:**
- updated email validation regex

---

@Pomax I would love to get some help from you to check if that regex looks sane... It thinks `11%@hi.com` is a valid email which seems odd to me

but 

```
curl --data ""lang=pt-BR&newsletters=mozilla-learning-network&email=11%@hi.com"" https://basket-dev.allizom.org/news/subscribe/
```

returns `{""status"": ""ok""}` so maybe `11%@hi.com` is really a valid email?

This is a pure refactor, without code changes other than relocations to their own files and the necessary wrapper code to call functions from these new files. Each set of tasks that seemed a logical cluster has been put in its own file in the `./gulp/` directory, with shared resources housed in `./gulp/shared/`.

The ""npm start"" command should still do exactly the same thing, but some of the gulp tasks that are used less frequently might still be missing dependencies, so if review can be run on all gulp tasks, that'll help us rule out missing deps., typos, etc.

This refactor allows us to examine which tasks we actually still use, and following that, how we can change as many of them as possible to ""npm scripts"" instead.

  of each expander section will set browser's current URL to a
  permalink for the section. Visiting a section directly through its
  permalink will also automatically expand that section to attract
  users' attention.
- Tools page has been added (https://teach.mozilla.org/tools). Currently
  there's no UI element on the site that leads to that page. However,
  a menu item ""Tools"" will be added to the sidebar in a follow-up release.
- The release process has been documented in `RELEASE.md`.

- Each section in the Web Literacy Map can now be visited via a
  unique permalink. Clicking on the section sign (§) at the top-right
  of each expander section will set browser's current URL to a
  permalink for the section. Visiting a section directly through its
  permalink will also automatically expand that section to attract
  users' attention.
- Tools page has been added (https://teach.mozilla.org/tools). Currently
  there's no UI element on the site that leads to that page. However,
  a menu item ""Tools"" will be added to the sidebar in a follow-up release.
- The release process has been documented in `RELEASE.md`.
- An experimental lightweight dynamic server has been added, which
  dynamically generates requested HTML content. Documentation
  can be found in `README.md`.
- Unit tests have been added for the homepage.
- Hero unit images have been optimized and converted to JPG. In fact
  an image converter helper is in place now so we can easily optimize any
  images in the future.
### Changed
- The marker popups in the Clubs map are now much easier to read.
- Clicking on the location label of a Club will automatically zoom to
  that location pin on the Clubs map.
- All `mailto:` links on the website now point to
  `teachtheweb@mozillafoundation.org`.
- The ""club curriculum"" link under the ""Write, Remix, or find Curriculum""
  section of the Clubs Toolkit now points to the Teaching Activities
  page.
- The Clubs Toolkit, Web Literacy Map, and Event Details section
  of the Event Resources page are now useful when printed. (Previously,
  their collapsed/inactive content would be hidden.)
- The Clubs page no longer makes superfluous network requests to
  retrieve the Clubs list.
- Only .jpg, .png, and .svg files in the `/img` directory are being watched
  (when running `npm start`) and copied to the `/dist` directory.
- Ionicons icon font has been dropped for FontAwesome.
- Hero unit background images are positioned at center top. This improves
  focus on the main visual interests on the photographs, especially on
  mobile viewports.

- The close box for our modals was just being announced as ""button""; now it's ""Close button"".
- The ""a network error occurred"" and ""your submission has some problems"" alerts on our modals aren't announced by screen readers because they don't have `role=""alert""` on them, which is now fixed. Also, NVDA doesn't seem to announce any `<ul>`'s within alerts, so I had to convert the lists to paragraphs. Which seems dumb, but I guess it's better than not announcing them at all?
- The ""Add Your Club"" button on the Clubs page was a link instead of a `<button>`, and because it didn't have a `href` attribute, it wasn't focusable with the keyboard. I changed it to a `<button>`.
- The club location autocomplete field now has a `<label>` associated with it.
- Changes between individual steps of the modal, e.g. going from the ""add your club"" form step to the ""thanks for your submission"" step, weren't announced by screen readers. We now define [ARIA Live Regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) so this is fixed.
- The way input focus was being handled between opening and closing the modal, and navigating between the individual steps in a modal, was terrible. I had no idea where my input focus was during these transitions, and often it was in an invalid place, e.g. still on the ""Add My Club"" button when the ""Add Your Club"" modal is in focus. I've fixed this so that, at the very least, the modal itself becomes focused when shown, and the DOM element that had focus before it was shown is re-focused when the modal closes. Also, a `StepView` component for multi-step modals has been added, which manages the auto-focusing of elements as users transition into a new step.

Other notes:
- The club location autocomplete field isn't very accessible to screen-readers, though at least it's fully usable via keyboard. Not really sure if this can be fixed without altering [`react-select`](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select) and there don't seem to be any issues in that project about accessibility, aside from the delete button being pronounced ""times"". 

Things still left to do:
- I should add unit tests for some of this stuff, but I'm holding off on it until we've done some QA and verified that this is the behavior we want.

We now define [ARIA Live Regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) so this is fixed.
- The way input focus was being handled between opening and closing the modal, and navigating between the individual steps in a modal, was terrible. I had no idea where my input focus was during these transitions, and often it was in an invalid place, e.g. still on the ""Add My Club"" button when the ""Add Your Club"" modal is in focus. I've fixed this so that, at the very least, the modal itself becomes focused when shown, and the DOM element that had focus before it was shown is re-focused when the modal closes. Also, a `StepView` component for multi-step modals has been added, which manages the auto-focusing of elements as users transition into a new step.

Other notes:
- The club location autocomplete field isn't very accessible to screen-readers, though at least it's fully usable via keyboard. Not really sure if this can be fixed without altering [`react-select`](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select) and there don't seem to be any issues in that project about accessibility, aside from the delete button being pronounced ""times"". 

Things still left to do:
- I should add unit tests for some of this stuff, but I'm holding off on it until we've done some QA and verified that this is the behavior we want.

This reverts commit 8720213ff825d00a293803fe1b66323fff5bc3a4.

The AccessibleAlert component makes things work with VoiceOver in
OS X Safari and Chrome, but then *breaks* things in NVDA because
it keeps announcing the empty alert instead of the dialog contents.

It's easier to just keep the code as simple as possible and rely on
UA vendors to make role=""alert"" work in a consistent way that doesn't
drive developers insane."

This is done via a new ad-hoc gulp plugin at `lib/gulp-image-converter.js` which uses [`lwip`](https://www.npmjs.com/lwip) to convert images.

Specifically, we convert the hero unit images to JPEG files (instead of their current PNG), as [Google's Image Optimization Guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization?hl=en#selecting-the-right-image-format) recommends using it for photos.

We currently save the JPEGs at a quality of 70 (max is 100), but this can easily be tweaked in our gulpfile if we want to experiment with the best image-quality-to-file-size tradeoff. We can even specify a custom optimization level for different images if we want.

Currently running `gulp copy-images` by itself results in the following output:

So converting all the hero unit images currently takes about 1 second on my 2012 Macbook Pro. Right now, that is the main downside of doing this at build time, but perhaps when we're able to use [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/), we can simply cache the converted images in the repository without bloating it.

In the future, I'd like to use this gulp plugin to also automatically generate non-retina images from our retina images, which should make it easier for us to create new content while also reducing the repository size and preventing errors like https://github.com/mozilla/teach.webmaker.org/pull/1025#discussion_r32309272 and #845.

> ![2015-06-10_11-51-51](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/124687/8087137/28d126d2-0f67-11e5-8d1d-44ae16a8ae39.jpg)

When a user hovers over the icon or the city name, the line is highlighted in blue (the standard link color). When they click on it, the page immediately scrolls up to the map and focuses in on the club (the behavior is identical to what happens when the user clicks ""take me to my club"" at the end of the club submission process).

Note that this isn't an accessible solution, as the map marker only responds to click events and isn't focusable via the keyboard, but that's because the map itself isn't particularly accessible. I guess it might be a good idea to add support for sighted but keyboard-only users, since they might still want to be able to see where in the world the club is located, but I'm not sure if there's any good solution for non-sighted users. Other than perhaps adding some [`sr-only`](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#conveying-meaning-to-assistive-technologies) text after the city name that contains the region/country information too, so it's not ambiguous to screen reader users. I guess I recommend filing separate issues for these rather than addressing them in this PR.

Also, the code here is a lot bigger than one would expect, because we have to pass the new `onZoomToLocation` prop through a few levels of components. And because our test suite sorta violated DRY, I decided to refactor things a bit while making tests still pass without raising any React warnings.

- A new ""Protect Your Data"" teaching activity has been added,
  and is now available at `activities/protect-your-data/`.
### Changed
- New clubs are no longer automatically publicly visible; instead, they
  are initially set to a ""pending"" state, and can be approved or
  denied by staff on the back-end. A ""My Clubs"" section above the
  rest of the clubs now informs the user about their clubs and their
  approval statuses. Users are also informed about the approval flow
  when they add a new club.
- The list of recent blog posts on the homepage is no longer hard-coded,
  but dynamically pulled from the blog's RSS feed via the Google Feed API.
  (We thought this was in 0.0.8, but it wasn't.)
- The ""Learn"" CTA at the bottom of the Teach Like Mozilla page
  has been changed to ""Understand"", with the sub-copy changed to
  ""Learn more about the Web Literacy Map"".
- The Home and About pages now consistently refer to ""the Mozilla
  Learning Network"", rather than ""Mozilla Learning Networks"".
- The decorative icons at the bottom CTAs of pages now have null
  `alt` text, improving accessibility.
- When sharing a Teach site page on Facebook, the page description is
  now the blurb from the About Us page (""We want more people to see
  themselves as citizens of the web..."") rather than the footer text
  (""The Hive Learning Networks, stewarded by Mozilla..."").

1936,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/988,988,Tag and release v0.0.9.,"### Added
- A new ""Protect Your Data"" teaching activity has been added,
  and is now available at `activities/protect-your-data/`.
### Changed
- New clubs are no longer automatically publicly visible; instead, they
  are initially set to a ""pending"" state, and can be approved or
  denied by staff on the back-end. A ""My Clubs"" section above the
  rest of the clubs now informs the user about their clubs and their
  approval statuses. Users are also informed about the approval flow
  when they add a new club.
- The list of recent blog posts on the homepage is no longer hard-coded,
  but dynamically pulled from the blog's RSS feed via the Google Feed API.
  (We thought this was in 0.0.8, but it wasn't.)
- The ""Learn"" CTA at the bottom of the Teach Like Mozilla page
  has been changed to ""Understand"", with the sub-copy changed to
  ""Learn more about the Web Literacy Map"".
- The Home and About pages now consistently refer to ""the Mozilla
  Learning Network"", rather than ""Mozilla Learning Networks"".
- The decorative icons at the bottom CTAs of pages now have null
  `alt` text, improving accessibility.
- When sharing a Teach site page on Facebook, the page description is
  now the blurb from the About Us page (""We want more people to see
  themselves as citizens of the web..."") rather than the footer text
  (""The Hive Learning Networks, stewarded by Mozilla..."").
- When the Web Literacy Basics page is shown, the Mozilla Clubs section of
  the nav is no longer expanded.

- [x] Add tests for `ClubStatusLabel`.
- [x] Add tests for `ClubLists`.
- [x] There's a bug where logging out will still show the unapproved clubs for the previous user. This is because our existing code assumes that the club list won't change when the current user changes; however, this assumption is broken with the club approval flow changes, so we need to account for that.

This is intended to resolve #585.

I'm thinking for now that we can just build it and use it alongside the existing static site  generator, and simply switch over once we decide it's stable and performant enough to use in production.

Tasks left to do (can be filed as separate issues):
- [ ] Add proper error handling (e.g., ""500 Internal Server Error"") to the server. (Update: filed as #1007.)
- [ ] The sitemap isn't currently being generated. This will take a bit of work, since the existing sitemap is generated by crawling all the `index.html` files of the static site, which isn't feasible for the dynamic server. (Update: filed as #1008.)
- [ ] Appropriate static files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc) should be delivered as compressed/gzipped content, at least in production. (Update: filed as #1009.)
- [ ] Static files should be delivered with reasonable cache headers, at least in production. (Update: filed as #1010.)
- [ ] Assets should be delivered with relevant security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [x] All packages that aren't required for production deployment should be moved into the `devDependencies` section of `package.json`.
- [ ] ~~Include the `git-rev` meta in generated pages.~~ Turns out this is really hard to do when an app is deployed to Heroku. We should probably just settle for showing the version number from `package.json` for now.
- [x] Static files should all be copied into the `dist` directory via our gulpfile, rather than instantiating multiple `express.static()` middleware instances for each directory.
- [x] Add some tests.
- [x] react-router redirects should actually generate 302s from the server, rather than web pages telling non-JS users to visit the new location.

Conflicts:
	package.json"
2078,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/934,934,Tag and release v0.0.5.,"### Added
- A link to ""Site Administration"" now appears under the logout
  link if the current user is staff.
- The word ""(optional)"" has been added next to non-required
  fields in the ""Add Your Club"" modal.
- Links to view the current page/route in PageSpeed Insights
  and Tenon have been added to the dev version modal and
  the manual tests page. Users are directed to install ngrok
  if they're accessing the pages at a non-public IP.
- Added notes about accessibility testing and ngrok
  to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Added environment variables `MAILINGLIST_URL`
  and `MAILINGLIST_PRIVACY_NAME`.
- The site now generates `index.html` files for redirects. This
  was done so that `/clubs/curriculum/` redirects to 
  `/activities/web-lit-basics/`.
- `lib/changelog.js` can be used as a node script to help
  update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Aspects of the structure and accuracy of this
  changelog are now verified by the automated test suite.
### Changed
- The Clubs Curriculum page has been renamed to 
  Web Literacy Basics, and is now available at
  `/activities/web-lit-basics/`. It's no longer accessible
  through the sidebar, but is instead listed as the
  first teaching kit in the Teaching Activities page.
- The ""Events"" section on the sidebar has been renamed to
  ""Maker Party"".
- A number of `alt` attributes for purely decorative
  images in the sidebar have been nulled, streamlining
  the experience for users with screen readers.
- The hamburger always expands if one of the links in its
  collapsed area becomes focused, improving navigation for
  sighted users who can only use the keyboard for navigation.
- Signing up for the Maker Party mailing list now shows
  a ""Thank you"" modal when the user is returned to the 
  site from BSD.
- Moved all documentation about manual testing to
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- We're now using webpack to generate the static
  `index.html` files, massively speeding up their
  regeneration during development. The webpack bundle
  used to generate the index files is put in a new
  `build` directory.
## Removed
- References to ""add your event"" have been removed from
  the site, as we're not collecting data about individual
  Maker Party events this year.
- Unlinked calls-to-action have been removed from the bottom
  of the Clubs and Clubs Toolkit pages.

2081,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/934,934,Tag and release v0.0.5.,"### Added
- A link to ""Site Administration"" now appears under the logout
  link if the current user is staff.
- The word ""(optional)"" has been added next to non-required
  fields in the ""Add Your Club"" modal.
- Links to view the current page/route in PageSpeed Insights
  and Tenon have been added to the dev version modal and
  the manual tests page. Users are directed to install ngrok
  if they're accessing the pages at a non-public IP.
- Added notes about accessibility testing and ngrok
  to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Added environment variables `MAILINGLIST_URL`
  and `MAILINGLIST_PRIVACY_NAME`.
- The site now generates `index.html` files for redirects. This
  was done so that `/clubs/curriculum/` redirects to 
  `/activities/web-lit-basics/`.
- `lib/changelog.js` can be used as a node script to help
  update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Aspects of the structure and accuracy of this
  changelog are now verified by the automated test suite.
### Changed
- The Clubs Curriculum page has been renamed to 
  Web Literacy Basics, and is now available at
  `/activities/web-lit-basics/`. It's no longer accessible
  through the sidebar, but is instead listed as the
  first teaching kit in the Teaching Activities page.
- The ""Events"" section on the sidebar has been renamed to
  ""Maker Party"".
- A number of `alt` attributes for purely decorative
  images in the sidebar have been nulled, streamlining
  the experience for users with screen readers.
- The hamburger always expands if one of the links in its
  collapsed area becomes focused, improving navigation for
  sighted users who can only use the keyboard for navigation.
- Signing up for the Maker Party mailing list now shows
  a ""Thank you"" modal when the user is returned to the 
  site from BSD.
- Moved all documentation about manual testing to
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- We're now using webpack to generate the static
  `index.html` files, massively speeding up their
  regeneration during development. The webpack bundle
  used to generate the index files is put in a new
  `build` directory.
## Removed
- References to ""add your event"" have been removed from
  the site, as we're not collecting data about individual
  Maker Party events this year.
- Unlinked calls-to-action have been removed from the bottom

- The site now generates `index.html` files for redirects. This
  was done so that `/clubs/curriculum/` redirects to 
  `/activities/web-lit-basics/`.
- `lib/changelog.js` can be used as a node script to help
  update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Aspects of the structure and accuracy of this
  changelog are now verified by the automated test suite.
### Changed
- The Clubs Curriculum page has been renamed to 
  Web Literacy Basics, and is now available at
  `/activities/web-lit-basics/`. It's no longer accessible
  through the sidebar, but is instead listed as the
  first teaching kit in the Teaching Activities page.
- The ""Events"" section on the sidebar has been renamed to
  ""Maker Party"".
- A number of `alt` attributes for purely decorative
  images in the sidebar have been nulled, streamlining
  the experience for users with screen readers.
- The hamburger always expands if one of the links in its
  collapsed area becomes focused, improving navigation for
  sighted users who can only use the keyboard for navigation.
- Signing up for the Maker Party mailing list now shows
  a ""Thank you"" modal when the user is returned to the 
  site from BSD.
- Moved all documentation about manual testing to
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- We're now using webpack to generate the static
  `index.html` files, massively speeding up their
  regeneration during development. The webpack bundle
  used to generate the index files is put in a new
  `build` directory.
## Removed
- References to ""add your event"" have been removed from
  the site, as we're not collecting data about individual
  Maker Party events this year.
- Unlinked calls-to-action have been removed from the bottom
  of the Clubs and Clubs Toolkit pages.

2117,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/927,927,Ensure sidebar is uncollapsed when its items are focused,"There's currently a bug in the collapsed (hamburger) version of the navigation whereby if the keyboard is used to navigate through the site, focus seems to ""disappear"" after tabbing past the hamburger. This is because focus is actually _inside_ the collapsed area of the sidebar, but it's still collapsed, so it appears as though focus has been lost. Pressing tab a few more times eventually moves focus out of the sidebar and back to the main content.

One way to fix this would be to ensure that the sidebar links can't be navigated through unless the hamburger is used to toggle the navigation, but this is actually nontrivial due to the way that we're handling the collapse functionality. An easier solution is to simply ensure that the sidebar automatically un-collapses whenever any of its links are focused, which is what I've done in this PR.

2118,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/926,926,Various easy accessibility fixes,"Made a few simple accessibility fixes, many surfaced by tenon.io:
- Set `role` on the navbar, main content, and footer. In NVDA, for example, pressing `d` allows users to easily navigate between [landmark roles](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_landmarks_to_identify_regions_of_a_page), which makes it much easier for them to navigate to important parts of the page if these are defined.
- The list of Hives in `/activities/` has purely [decorative](https://github.com/mozilla/teach.webmaker.org/pull/905#issue-76379588) Hive logos next to each Hive city, whose `alt` attributes should be nulled.

2145,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/905,905,Improve accessibility of sidebar alt attributes.,"I was [using NVDA to test our site's accessibility](https://www.marcozehe.de/articles/how-to-use-nvda-and-firefox-to-test-your-web-pages-for-accessibility/) and noticed that we're sometimes using `alt` tags in unhelpful ways. This PR fixes a few of them in the sidebar:
- The Mozilla wordmark at the top-left of the page is actually a link to the ""home"" (i.e., root) of the site. This is fairly obvious to users who have vision, but just communicating ""Mozilla logo"" to vision-impaired users doesn't actually help them understand where the link will take them. So I changed its alt text to ""Mozilla Learning Home"".
- The alt text for all the sidebar icons isn't needed, because those images are purely decorative. The existing alt text we have actually results in screen readers repeating the name of the sidebar link _twice_ (once from the alt text, again for the visible text), which is quite annoying. On this matter, the [W3C Techniques for providing useful text alternatives](http://dev.w3.org/html5/alt-techniques/#sec5) states:
  
  > Purely decorative images must be marked up so they can be ignored by assistive technology with a null alt attribute (`alt=""""`) or preferably use CSS techniques. If the image isn't providing the user any informative content or enhancing greater understanding of the content, then the `alt` attribute must be empty.
  
  So, I set `alt=""""` for all the sidebar icons. Note that this is distinctly different from leaving out the `alt` attribute altogether, as screen readers would then try to substitute something else (like the URL of the image) for the alt text.

So I added a hook in the form submit handler that shows an alert message telling the developer that we're simulating a successful mailing list signup, and redirecting the user back to the events page. This makes it a bit easier to test successful signup flow during development.

The simulated behavior only occurs during development and if `MAILINGLIST_URL` isn't defined.

After a bit of research it appears that jsbeautify isn't a linter, it actually _reformats_ your code to conform to a style guide. I don't mind linting, but I think there are potentially multiple solutions to a code style warning, and I want to be able to choose between them when I reformat my code--not have a beautifier make a decision for me.

At most, I think the beautification should be an _optional_ step a developer can take to fix their lint warnings, rather than a required part of the build/test process. And since jsbeautify isn't working right now (as explained in #426) I'd rather just remove it.

This has a number of benefits:
- **Rebuilding index HTML files is a _lot_ faster.** We don't have to spawn a subprocess anymore, and webpack rebuilds only the code that's changed.
- Index HTML files are only rebuilt when an actual file they use changes. Currently, for example, changing `lib/travis.js` will trigger a full rebuild of the index HTML files, even though that file has nothing to do with rebuilding index HTML files.
- We can reuse more of our webpack code pipeline in node, rather than relying on a completely separate build toolchain (in the form of `node-jsx`). ~~We haven't completely decoupled ourselves from that toolchain yet, as everything outside of `gulp watch` still uses it, but the plan is to migrate away from it, so that our build toolchain is ultimately simplified.~~ ~~We're still using `node-jsx` but only for running node-side tests.~~ This should also make migrating to #585 (and quickly iterating on the server during development) easier.

Limitations:
- We're not rebuilding the `sitemap.xml` file in `gulp watch` anymore. Hopefully not that big a deal.
- ~~Until we've completely replaced our use of `node-jsx` with webpack, we're moving away from [dev/prod parity](http://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity), which isn't awesome. So we should finish that migration ASAP.~~
- Running the `test/index-static.test.js` test is slower because it builds the webpack bundle now, but I'd rather it just run slower than assume the developer manually builds it before running the test, and then have devs get frustrated when they change the code but the tests still fail.
- ~~We're building the index HTML generator bundle in `dist/index-static`, which probably isn't awesome because it's really just an intermediate file that isn't intended for distribution.

This has a number of benefits:
- **Rebuilding index HTML files is a _lot_ faster.** We don't have to spawn a subprocess anymore, and webpack rebuilds only the code that's changed.
- Index HTML files are only rebuilt when an actual file they use changes. Currently, for example, changing `lib/travis.js` will trigger a full rebuild of the index HTML files, even though that file has nothing to do with rebuilding index HTML files.
- We can reuse more of our webpack code pipeline in node, rather than relying on a completely separate build toolchain (in the form of `node-jsx`). ~~We haven't completely decoupled ourselves from that toolchain yet, as everything outside of `gulp watch` still uses it, but the plan is to migrate away from it, so that our build toolchain is ultimately simplified.~~ ~~We're still using `node-jsx` but only for running node-side tests.~~ This should also make migrating to #585 (and quickly iterating on the server during development) easier.

Limitations:
- We're not rebuilding the `sitemap.xml` file in `gulp watch` anymore. Hopefully not that big a deal.
- ~~Until we've completely replaced our use of `node-jsx` with webpack, we're moving away from [dev/prod parity](http://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity), which isn't awesome. So we should finish that migration ASAP.~~

A few days ago @mmmavis brought up the question of how to test to make sure that our forms worked on browsers that don't support HTML5 form validation. I told her that she could use an iPhone or iPad, since Mobile Safari is the only remaining browser whose latest version still doesn't support it, but obviously this solution is suboptimal, especially for developers who don't have iOS devices on-hand.

Then I learned about the nifty [`novalidate` attribute](http://www.wufoo.com/html5/attributes/11-novalidate.html) for form elements.

This PR adds a `HTML5_NOVALIDATE` environment variable that, if set to `on`, hacks `React.createElement` to automatically add the `novalidate` attribute to all form elements generated by React code (on both the client and server/static-side).

Another option is to just point developers to http://novalidate.com/, a bookmarklet that does roughly the same thing. Or we could just tell devs to temporarily add `novalidate` to the relevant form while testing it. Or we could add a checkbox to the developer ribbon modal that allows anyone to dynamically change the value at runtime, which could make manual testing by QA folks easier. The possibilities are endless!

2409,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/626,626,Support OAuth2 (take 2),"This is a different attempt at supporting OAuth2 (#576). A few distinctions from the previous attempt in #608:
- This one _removes_ support for Persona-based login. There's just such a big difference in the way that the two auth systems work that it's easier to substitute one out for the other wholesale, and migrate to it once the new auth is [stable](https://github.com/mozilla/teach.webmaker.org/issues/576#issuecomment-91233234).

This is occurring because sometimes the clubs page has updated the props of the Map component before the Map component has loaded leaflet/mapbox.

The Map component's `componentDidUpdate` assumes that the map has already initialized itself at the time that the props have changed; this used to always be the case, but when we made the component lazy-load mapbox/leaflet in #448, its initialization became asynchronous, which made it possible for `componentDidUpdate` to be called before the component was actually initialized.

This simple fix resolves that problem.

Much of this is a fallback for browsers that don't support HTML5 form validation, which fixes #540.

However, it also validates the ""location"" field, which currently has very bad (and untested) validation that raises a `window.alert` if the user hasn't filled it out.

One thing that this does _not_ currently do is validate the website field (if it's filled out). That's because there's an open question on how to exactly to resolve #424, and I'd like to resolve that in a separate PR.

The only side effect of this fix is that the modal no longer uses cool [kinetic scrolling](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101026053313AA6aQv2). However, I think kinetic scrolling is only particularly useful for scrolling through areas that have lots of scrollable content; because our modals are all pretty small, scrolling through them in a non-kinetic way on iOS shouldn't be that big a deal.

Another aspect I like about this fix is that the CSS is only going to affect iOS, and shouldn't have weird side effects on other browsers.

2451,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/580,580,Add css transitions for hamburger toggle.,"This fixes #575.

I set the transition to 0.5 seconds instead of 1 because when collapsing the burger, there is a [somewhat annoying](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3508605/css-transition-height-0-to-height-auto#comment10354379_8331169) delay due to the fact that our `max-height` is transitioning from a very high value to 0 over that period.

This is also part of why I've added an opacity transition in addition to the max-height transition: the opacity change is immediately visible, which makes the hamburger feel more responsive when the content is being collapsed.

However, there's another reason for the opacity change too. Without it, some of the content inside the sidebar still displays when the hamburger is collapsed:

I'm not exactly sure why this is; maybe because we're using `position: relative` for some things inside the sidebar? In any case, I tried `overflow: hidden` on the sidebar content and that also results in bad things, so it was easier to just transition opacity to 0 when collapsing to ensure that the stuff inside the sidebar can't be seen.

It also allows developers to force-enable this ""safe mode"" by adding `safemode=on` to the querystring of any page.

Note that I did look into [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) for this but because our detection is so simplistic, I found it easier to just borrow a snippet of code from them rather than create a custom build of Modernizr outright. That said, as I mention in the code comments, if our feature detection becomes more complex, we should probably consider migrating to Modernizr.

- Showing both ""Toronto, Ontario, Canada"" (the city) and ""Toronto St, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"" (the address). Only the city is shown now.

I should note that my fix relies a lot on the specific format of the GeoJSON that Mapbox's ""public beta"" geocoding API returns, but it adheres to the guidelines listed under the ""Response format"" section of their [geocoding API documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/geocoding/). Specifically, we're relying on the formatting of feature IDs and feature `text`, `center`, and `context`, all of which are documented as being stable.

2467,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/551,551,Sidebar content on mobile collapses when URL path changes.,"This fixes #509. I didn't implement an `onClick` handler because that would also require implementing keydown handlers for accessibility and all that junk, which would additionally mean lots of unit tests.

I also figured that what we _really_ want is to have the sidebar collapse on mobile whenever the current URL changes, not necessarily just when users click on a link in the sidebar. Since that was also easier to implement and test, I went with that approach.

I'm regularly publishing my progress so far to http://mozteach.toolness.org/events/.

Notes:
- The 2x version of the hero unit image seems kind of big at 1.5mb. If iPhone 5's are downloading this, that seems kind of excessive if they're being retrieved over a 3G connection. I'm also not really sure if it's even going to make much of a difference from the 1x size on such small devices, but I dunno. I kind of wish there were a way to tell a browser ""yo, if this image is going to be on a retina display with a good wifi connection _and_ will be shown at a size larger than a postage stamp, then use this higher-res version."" (Maybe it's already possible to do this and I just don't know about it?)
- I'm using the `values` class from the site landing page to do the ""Join us for the global Maker Party"" CTA area right now, because it's so visually similar. `values` doesn't seem very semantically relevant to what the content is, though, so I wonder if we should rename the class, or if we should make a mixin class in LESS, or something else entirely.
- I'm using the `PageEndCTA` component but it's not _technically_ at the end of the page--really it's sort of the middle of the page... Dunno if that matters.
- I really dislike the way I styled the ""sign up for Maker Party emails"" form, but it works for now. Left a TODO in the code about refactoring it later.
- For some reason the email field in that form doesn't work on Firefox 36.0.4 and I can't figure out why--seems to have something to do with the CSS on it, as disabling that makes the field work okay. I think it's OK for now b/c that form doesn't actually do anything yet anyways.

- The 2x version of the hero unit image seems kind of big at 1.5mb. If iPhone 5's are downloading this, that seems kind of excessive if they're being retrieved over a 3G connection. I'm also not really sure if it's even going to make much of a difference from the 1x size on such small devices, but I dunno. I kind of wish there were a way to tell a browser ""yo, if this image is going to be on a retina display with a good wifi connection _and_ will be shown at a size larger than a postage stamp, then use this higher-res version."" (Maybe it's already possible to do this and I just don't know about it?)
- I'm using the `values` class from the site landing page to do the ""Join us for the global Maker Party"" CTA area right now, because it's so visually similar. `values` doesn't seem very semantically relevant to what the content is, though, so I wonder if we should rename the class, or if we should make a mixin class in LESS, or something else entirely.
- I'm using the `PageEndCTA` component but it's not _technically_ at the end of the page--really it's sort of the middle of the page... Dunno if that matters.
- I really dislike the way I styled the ""sign up for Maker Party emails"" form, but it works for now. Left a TODO in the code about refactoring it later.
- For some reason the email field in that form doesn't work on Firefox 36.0.4 and I can't figure out why--seems to have something to do with the CSS on it, as disabling that makes the field work okay. I think it's OK for now b/c that form doesn't actually do anything yet anyways.

Notes:
- The 2x version of the hero unit image seems kind of big at 1.5mb. If iPhone 5's are downloading this, that seems kind of excessive if they're being retrieved over a 3G connection. I'm also not really sure if it's even going to make much of a difference from the 1x size on such small devices, but I dunno. I kind of wish there were a way to tell a browser ""yo, if this image is going to be on a retina display with a good wifi connection _and_ will be shown at a size larger than a postage stamp, then use this higher-res version."" (Maybe it's already possible to do this and I just don't know about it?)
- I'm using the `values` class from the site landing page to do the ""Join us for the global Maker Party"" CTA area right now, because it's so visually similar. `values` doesn't seem very semantically relevant to what the content is, though, so I wonder if we should rename the class, or if we should make a mixin class in LESS, or something else entirely.
- I'm using the `PageEndCTA` component but it's not _technically_ at the end of the page--really it's sort of the middle of the page... Dunno if that matters.
- I really dislike the way I styled the ""sign up for Maker Party emails"" form, but it works for now. Left a TODO in the code about refactoring it later.
- For some reason the email field in that form doesn't work on Firefox 36.0.4 and I can't figure out why--seems to have something to do with the CSS on it, as disabling that makes the field work okay. I think it's OK for now b/c that form doesn't actually do anything yet anyways.
- I tried using `react-slick` for the carousel but it was terrible at responsively scaling itself to its container width. I used this as an opportunity to try `react-bootstrap` and its carousel works much better.
- However, `react-bootstrap`'s carousel makes `react-a11y` unhappy, so I had to disable its warnings. Coupled with the issues I ran into in #398 and other [workarounds](https://github.com/mozilla/teach.webmaker.org/blob/39e66bfd6f49ec1191e886cce2257edbed50d13a/components/map.jsx#L212-L218) we've had to do to appease `react-a11y`, I think this is for the best. We should probably just wait for that library to mature (and/or help it mature) before we start using it again.

Just a few things here:
- changed the device widths to match up with more common devices
- move the devices object up to the top so it's easier to maintain/add to etc.
- manually set height since it will be more useful for testing actual device sizes, above the fold, etc.
- do actual sizes + scroll x instead of scaling -- i think especially for checking visual details, it's preferable to check the actual size and just scroll horizontally
- show mobile first in the queue since it's the most different/most likely to be overlooked 
- move the labels to the top of the manual test iframes so they're easier to see/read
- add a bit more emphasis to the route links to distinguish the sections

What do you think @toolness @gvn?

By ""rudimentary"" I mean that a number of dialogs have been stubbed out with `window.alert()` but communication with the Teach API is done properly and only the owner (creator) of a club has the ability to delete it.

Other notes:
- In general I am trying to make as few components directly use the teach API as possible. so that components are passed in information via `props` and use callbacks etc to delegate state change to their parents. I _think_ this is a [best practice](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/two-way-binding-helpers.html) in React and makes the operation of our app more understandable.
- As such, the `Map` component no longer directly accesses the Teach API, and is instead given a list of clubs by its parent.
- Because Leaflet renders marker popups as static HTML, we can't make those React components. So we need to do some annoying things to integrate UI in the popups.

TODOs:
- [ ] I should really move the `autobind` function out of `teach-api.js` and into its own module, and add tests for it.
- [ ] Even though the UI is in a lot of flux, I should probably at least add a few tests for the Clubs page to ensure that the modals work.
- [ ] Obviously most/all of the `window.alert`s need to be converted to more user-friendly interactions, many of which have already been mocked up by our designers. (But I think there may be some edge cases that haven't been mocked up!)

2640,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/learning.mozilla.org/pulls/325,325,Add a Teach API Client mixin,"This PR does a number of things:
- Components now access the Teach API via a mixin rather than a global singleton. This is ultimately done via [React Contexts](https://www.tildedave.com/2014/11/15/introduction-to-contexts-in-react-js.html); since we're already using them ourselves as of #312, I figured we might as well use them here too. Among other things, it allows for less error-prone event binding.
- The `stub-router-context` module is now called the `stub-context`, as it stubs out the Teach API too.
- A new `stub-teach-api` module can be used to stub out the Teach API in nifty ways for testing. `login.test.jsx` has been modified to use it.
- The `routes.test.jsx` module is gone now; it was a very fragile test that was a pain to constantly fix, and didn't actually test anything particularly useful. It'll be easier to just monkeypatch the `Link` tag at runtime to log a warning if any Links are ever created that are referred to by path instead of route name.

Notes:
- I'm using [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) here because it works on both in node and the browser. It's quite likely that we'll eventually want a dynamic server, or at least have the static site generator pull data from the Teach API for its generated pages, so it'll be nice if our code works in both environments out-of-the-box.
- Ideally the teach API object should be passed into any component that needs it, but it's cumbersome and arguably what [React Contexts](https://www.tildedave.com/2014/11/15/introduction-to-contexts-in-react-js.html) were made for. However, Contexts aren't documented yet, which makes me reluctant to use them; furthermore, because `react-router` uses them, it's actually impossible for us to pass them through our view heirarchy _without_ using them. So instead of that, I'm just making the teach API a global singleton for now, and we can migrate it to use Contexts once they're properly added to React. (Well, either that or we just decide to use Contexts anyways.)
- Right now we're using `window.alert()` for error conditions; this isn't awesome, but given that we'll be migrating away from persona-based login ASAP anyways, I'm hoping it's ok as a stopgap for launch.
- We're now including sinon via a script tag instead of a require; see the commit log of fb8c7bc74dbaab5e5377a001631e0f091d30f51b for more details.
- Previously, our browser tests weren't cleaning up components they created, which resulted in lots of spurious (but still helpful!) memory leak warnings. So as of 7a9749a and 65d7313, they all clean up their stuff.
- The Teach API singleton has a `request()` method that is just like superagent's eponymous function, but it also adds the proper authorization header if the user is logged in. So we can use this whenever we need to make authenticated requests to the Teach API (I probably should've included this in a separate PR, apologies).

- [x] Add tests for `lib/teach-api`.

However, Contexts aren't documented yet, which makes me reluctant to use them; furthermore, because `react-router` uses them, it's actually impossible for us to pass them through our view heirarchy _without_ using them. So instead of that, I'm just making the teach API a global singleton for now, and we can migrate it to use Contexts once they're properly added to React. (Well, either that or we just decide to use Contexts anyways.)
- Right now we're using `window.alert()` for error conditions; this isn't awesome, but given that we'll be migrating away from persona-based login ASAP anyways, I'm hoping it's ok as a stopgap for launch.
- We're now including sinon via a script tag instead of a require; see the commit log of fb8c7bc74dbaab5e5377a001631e0f091d30f51b for more details.
- Previously, our browser tests weren't cleaning up components they created, which resulted in lots of spurious (but still helpful!) memory leak warnings. So as of 7a9749a and 65d7313, they all clean up their stuff.
- The Teach API singleton has a `request()` method that is just like superagent's eponymous function, but it also adds the proper authorization header if the user is logged in. So we can use this whenever we need to make authenticated requests to the Teach API (I probably should've included this in a separate PR, apologies).

Notes:
- I'm using [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) here because it works on both in node and the browser. It's quite likely that we'll eventually want a dynamic server, or at least have the static site generator pull data from the Teach API for its generated pages, so it'll be nice if our code works in both environments out-of-the-box.
- Ideally the teach API object should be passed into any component that needs it, but it's cumbersome and arguably what [React Contexts](https://www.tildedave.com/2014/11/15/introduction-to-contexts-in-react-js.html) were made for. However, Contexts aren't documented yet, which makes me reluctant to use them; furthermore, because `react-router` uses them, it's actually impossible for us to pass them through our view heirarchy _without_ using them. So instead of that, I'm just making the teach API a global singleton for now, and we can migrate it to use Contexts once they're properly added to React. (Well, either that or we just decide to use Contexts anyways.)
- Right now we're using `window.alert()` for error conditions; this isn't awesome, but given that we'll be migrating away from persona-based login ASAP anyways, I'm hoping it's ok as a stopgap for launch.
- We're now including sinon via a script tag instead of a require; see the commit log of fb8c7bc74dbaab5e5377a001631e0f091d30f51b for more details.
- Previously, our browser tests weren't cleaning up components they created, which resulted in lots of spurious (but still helpful!) memory leak warnings. So as of 7a9749a and 65d7313, they all clean up their stuff.
- The Teach API singleton has a `request()` method that is just like superagent's eponymous function, but it also adds the proper authorization header if the user is logged in. So we can use this whenever we need to make authenticated requests to the Teach API (I probably should've included this in a separate PR, apologies).

- **The static site generator.** This is our version of the ""server"", the program that runs on a build machine to generate the static website. These tests are located in the `test` directory.
- **The browser.** This is the code that runs in user's browsers to progressively enhance their experience. These tests are located in the `test/browser` directory.

Currently there's only trivial test suites for [`lib/config.js`](https://github.com/mozilla/teach.webmaker.org/blob/master/lib/config.js), which behaves differently in the two environments.

In both environments, [`should`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/should) is used for test assertions. This assertion library only works on IE9+, but that should be OK for us; I'm assuming at the moment that we'll essentially not progressively enhance anything below IE9, thus leaving nothing to test on the browser.

- [x] Document the testing system and process of adding new tests to `README.md`.

There are a few downsides to this approach:
- Currently, the generated static site uses relative URLs, which enables the site to be mounted anywhere in a directory structure. `react-router` really wants our site to be mounted at the root of a directory structure, so we'll likely lose this flexibility (or we'll need to implement some funky work-arounds, like hard-coding a directory prefix at build time).
- The current static site supports being accessed over the `file:` protocol but the new one won't.
- `react-router` doesn't seem to expose any APIs that allow us to traverse a site's URL structure. Right now `pages.URLS`, which is a list of all the URLs in the site, is hard-coded; I'll likely be able to iterate through the React structure of a `<Route>` element to generate a list of URLs but it will be hacky and might break with new versions of React or `react-router`.

I think that's about it, though. In exchange for this, though, we throw out a lot of my hacky/undocumented code, get hash-based navigation for free, and other [documented benefits](https://github.com/rackt/react-router#benefits-of-this-approach). It also means we won't have to implement a bunch of stuff in the future as the site grows, since `react-router` likely already supports our needs.

TODOs:
- [x] We're still setting the `<base href>` in generated static pages. Since we're no longer supporting being mounted at any URL, we can get rid of this, as it just complicates things. This also means providing absolute URLs to static assets like images and such.
