- added markdown support for `.md` files. ReStructuredText is still more powerful and flexible, but we should be able to land simple markdown docs.
- addressed warnings: linked `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` as a hidden doc, and linked `mobile_automation_setup.rst`.
- added the changelog from https://github.com/mozilla-releng/releasewarrior-2.0/blob/master/docs/CHANGELOG.md .
