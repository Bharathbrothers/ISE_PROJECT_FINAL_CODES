- Form fields, once typed in should show a highlighted list of suggestion (future test will verify the suggestions).
- From fields should be able to receive clicks and a keyboard `return`

There are still some sporadic failures due to waits timing out. I'm narrowing in on the causes, the causes may be due to some intermittent behavior on crash-stats or simply some additional waits that are focused on waiting for background network activity to complete.

The test verifies that 20 reports signatures are for the Firefox product. The test randomly looks at 20 report items. Due to the nature of crashes, the majority of them are for Firefox. Due the high probability that the test would select a report item that was Firefox even though other products were incorrectly in the report list, the test would pass.

There is a timing issue where the page returns too quickly and the `click_reports_tab()` method is being called too soon.

```
    crash_report_page = report_list.click_first_signature()
    crash_report_page.click_reports_tab()

I've run the test several times and the WebdriverWait appears to allow the page to load correctly before clicking through to the reports tab.

An example can be seen at [1].

When investigating it seemed that the current locator for the loading div is no longer valid - when running the code and inspecting the dom, an element with that locator never exists. I did find a new locator for the loading div, but the problem is we are doing a check for not visible, and that check can return True even before the div appears. My solution was to wait until there are actually reports displayed, rather than wait for the loader div to not be displayed.

126,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/Socorro-Tests/pulls/292,292,Fixes #291 - Wait for search results table to reflect selected columns,"Also address StaleElementException

This test was failing as per issue #291. I found that the problem was that after removing a column from the ""Show columns:"" list, and clicking the ""Search"" button, the removed column does appear in the results, but is later removed (must be some Javascript magic), so the test was failing when checking to see if the column was not there. I changed the code to wait for the column to be not present, and that seemed to fix the issue for me locally.

I also encountered a `StaleElementException` during my testing (see below), which I fixed in `table_column_names`.

Stack Trace of `StaleElementException`:

It bothers me that we need to add a property definition for each of these in every page object, when each property definition does the exact same thing. We can remove all of those property definitions by using the **getattr** method in this pull request.

I understand that the downside to this is that someone writing a test would not know which properties are available, except by looking at the code for the page object and finding the locators. Perhaps that is reason enough not to entertain using this method, but I thought it worth bringing up as it would certainly save a lot of code.
