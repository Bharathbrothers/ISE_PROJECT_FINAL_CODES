        script.className = 'webxray';

        script.setAttribute('data-baseuri', '-baseuri-/-lang-');
        document.body.appendChild(script);
    })();

```

To this:

``` js

    (function () {
        var doc = document;
        var urlParser = document.createElement('a');
        urlParser.href = window.location.href;

            doc = document.querySelector('iframe.embed-iframe').contentDocument;
        }

        var script = doc.createElement('script');

_Where `-baseuri-` and `-lang-` get replaced on build._

This sets the document to be either that of the make w/i the preview

Added CSP to goggles.webmaker.org. The only one thing is that - when you click on ""Active X-Ray Goggles"" CSP catches inline script somewhere, I am not quite sure where. I would really appreciate to get help finding it. 
I have a suggestion: There is a div: 

```
<div class=""bookmarklet""><a href="""" id=""bookmarklet-link"" class=""ui-btn""><span>{{ gettext(""Activate X-Ray Goggles"") }}</span></a></div>
```

It has 'id=""bookmarklet-link""' , I guess that it could be a cause for that.
