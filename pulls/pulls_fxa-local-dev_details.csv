As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

108,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fxa-local-dev/pulls/51,51,feat(vagrant): add provision script and improve current vagrantfile,"The following sections explains what changed and the reason. The Windows section explains the steps to get the machine working on windows and is here just for reference.

**Vagrantfile**
This file has been improved with the following changes:
1. Load configuration file (yaml) if exists.
2. Updated the format of box dependency declaration.
3. Memory and IP can be defined externally (in yaml file).
4. The atlas push must be configured in the external file.

**vagrant_provision.sh**
This file contains the steps required to build a working development environment.

**local_config.yaml.example**
This file should be duplicated and renamed to 'local_config.yaml' when overriding some configurations.

**servers.json**
Changed to not use the symlink when starting grunt (see windows host section).

**Windows Host**
Using Windows as host is not straight forward and requires some special steps. Why? Because VirtualBox does not support symlinks inside the shared folder. There is a way to get the symlinks working but it comes by default disabled because it can have an unpredictable behaviour.
There was an issue with paths because npm creates the nested tree of dependencies resulting in a path longer than 256 characters, but is already solved in Vagrant 1.8.0 with VirtualBox latest version of 4.3 and 5.

Steps to manually install
1. Install globally the following packages because the install needs to find their executables (does not find them because symlinks are not being created).
sudo npm install -g bower
sudo npm install -g node-pre-gyp
sudo npm install -g browserify
sudo npm install -g uglifyjs
1. Use the following command to set npm to ignore symlink creation (restart the ssh connection after).
   echo ""alias npm='npm --no-bin-links'"" >> ~/.bash_aliases
2. Since linux bash does not nest the alias, we need to change the 'install_all.sh' to manually ignore symlink creation. Run the following script.
   sed -i 's/npm i/npm i --no-bin-links/g' _scripts/install_all.sh
3. We need to tell virtualenv to not create symlinks. Put the following line after wait in 'install_all.sh' script.
   sed -i '/$(VIRTUALENV)/ s/ / --always-copy /' syncserver/Makefile
4. Replace the symlink at the end of 'install_all.sh' script (this will create a wrapper script to simulate the symlink).
   echo -e '#!/bin/bash\nexec ./node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 ""$@""' > pm2; chmod +x pm2

Now you can run 'npm install' as usual. After the install just revert the changes to the script.

Note: I do not recommend using Windows to develop anything related with the current trending web frameworks (even when using Vagrant), but if you really depend on Windows like me (for now), the above steps should help you getting the development machine working.

130,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fxa-local-dev/pulls/22,22,Improve readme for newcomers,"These  are based on me coming to the readme with a fresh pair of eyes. The information was all there but it was packed quite densely and not always in chronological order, which made things easy to miss.

To give you some context, here's my reasoning behind each change:
- Initially I didn't realise the first bullet was  a separate step. I thought it was just explanation for `npm install`. Hence making them all numbered bullets and then clarifying `Manually install...`.
- I don't use bash as my shell, so it was a bit annoying not being able to just copy/paste the `&&`ed commands. Hence splitting them across lines so they work for everyone.
- Added hierarchy to the pm2 bullets so its clear what belongs to what.
- Gave an explicit heading to the troubleshooting section, so that it's easier to spot when people are trying to figure out what's wrong.
- Link to the JDK instead of the JRE in the functional tests section. I tried the JRE but Selenium wouldn't work without the JDK for me.
