As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

32,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/jestr-pioneer-shield-study/pulls/13,13,Version 1.1,"This update primarily addresses performance issues identified in v1.0.0, but also includes improvements in [the upstream OpenWPM instrumentation library](https://github.com/mozilla/openwpm-webext-instrumentation/pull/31)

Changes in v1.1.0:
* Most telemetry events are now sent in batches oriented around [web navigations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webNavigation) (https://github.com/motin/jestr-pioneer-shield-study/issues/10), diminishing performance penalties associated with submitting many small packages via Pioneer telemetry (also mitigates https://github.com/motin/jestr-pioneer-shield-study/issues/8) (Status: Done)
* Batching events around navigations has the side-effect that the [500kb ping size limit](https://github.com/motin/jestr-pioneer-shield-study/issues/1) now applies to the sum of all http and js packets in a particular web navigation (instead of on a packet-by-packet basis), greatly decreasing the overall ping data volume [while still retaining as much relevant data as possible](https://github.com/motin/jestr-pioneer-shield-study/issues/11). Effective limits on navigation-specific telemetry payloads are now being determined by either the 500kb size limit, 10 second duration cutoff and 1000 events (whichever limit is hit first) (Status: Done)
* Includes [upstream instrumentation](https://github.com/mozilla/openwpm-webext-instrumentation) improvements, including performance improvements related to handling of data URLs [(the actual data from data URLs are now stripped away)](https://github.com/mozilla/openwpm-webext-instrumentation/issues/23) and fixes for https://github.com/mozilla/openwpm-webext-instrumentation/issues/26 and https://github.com/mozilla/openwpm-webext-instrumentation/issues/30 (Status: Done)",motin,793037,2018-11-23T02:04:59Z,CONTRIBUTOR,True,2890,1119,25,JESTr Pioneer Shield Study Add-on,TypeScript,4a8c5863ece7980114626e0b4e63e8b2848a3c43,Bump version to 1.1.0

Changes in v1.1.0:
* Most telemetry events are now sent in batches oriented around [web navigations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webNavigation) (https://github.com/motin/jestr-pioneer-shield-study/issues/10), diminishing performance penalties associated with submitting many small packages via Pioneer telemetry (also mitigates https://github.com/motin/jestr-pioneer-shield-study/issues/8) (Status: Done)
* Batching events around navigations has the side-effect that the [500kb ping size limit](https://github.com/motin/jestr-pioneer-shield-study/issues/1) now applies to the sum of all http and js packets in a particular web navigation (instead of on a packet-by-packet basis), greatly decreasing the overall ping data volume [while still retaining as much relevant data as possible](https://github.com/motin/jestr-pioneer-shield-study/issues/11).
