104,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/minion-backend/pulls/300,300,Fixed #184. Refactor and re-implement all views functional tests.,"This is a major patch.

First, there is a base class called Resource which is used to
create ""shortcut"" class to each of the backend's resource endpoint.
While it may be silly to create such class, as a test writer I find
this approach cleaner, more readable and easier to maintain than
the previous function-style.

Compare:

user = User(""bob@example.org"")
res = user.create()

to

res = self.create_user(""bob@eample.org"")

The class actually keeps certain ""states"" (at the attribute level).
Most of the classes have the same number of methods to access:

```
create, get, update, delete
```

Secondly, when we actually test scan, we no longer run basics plugin,
which would require a mini Flask server to be running. Instead,
I am making use of DelayPlugin from tests plugin. However, this test
is turned off due to bug #296 (and #300). Until we fix those two,
that test will be commented out.

Third, test_key method is gone. When we want to check whether
the response contains keys we are expecting to have, we fall back
to the native self.assertEqual. We basically do this:

```
self.assertEqual(set(key1),  set(key2))
```

where key1 and key2 are the set of keys we want to compare. While
doing this, I discovered that the original self._test_key method
contains a bug. We have added new keys to many responses but _test_key
did not catch the changes. With this new, more native approach,
I am able to detect the missing keys and this improve the realibitly of
our tests.

There are other changes, but in general this patch makes the tests
more robuts and easier to maintain.

Assurance team.

What hasn't been implemented is the abililty to resolve the target
to the IP addres within the scan.

This is due to time constraint; I need more time
to develop a test case (maybe I overthink, maybe just localhost
is a fine test case, maybe). It is relatively very easy to add that
check anyway. I already have the resolver function implemented
in utils.py

The changes are to allow a ""scna.json"". We will extend the network
access before saving the target url to database in the future
commits.

The test includes two sample JSON. One with both blacklist and whitelist
empted and one with a blacklist. We are using ipaddress to determine
whether or not an ip is part of a whitelist (remind: anything
not in blacklist is automatically consider whitelisted).

I also want to be able to specify ports in the future (whitelist
a particular port on 192.168.1.1)).

We can do this once this implemented is accepted.

Anyway. I have had a great time at Mozilla. See you on #websectools.

This is my last pull request as an intern on the Mozilla Security
Assurance team.

What hasn't been implemented is the abililty to resolve the target
to the IP addres within the scan.

This is due to time constraint; I need more time
to develop a test case (maybe I overthink, maybe just localhost
is a fine test case, maybe). It is relatively very easy to add that
check anyway. I already have the resolver function implemented
in utils.py

The changes are to allow a ""scna.json"". We will extend the network
access before saving the target url to database in the future
commits.

The test includes two sample JSON. One with both blacklist and whitelist
empted and one with a blacklist. We are using ipaddress to determine
whether or not an ip is part of a whitelist (remind: anything
not in blacklist is automatically consider whitelisted).

I also want to be able to specify ports in the future (whitelist
a particular port on 192.168.1.1)).

We can do this once this implemented is accepted.

Anyway. I have had a great time at Mozilla. See you on #websectools.

ticket #36. We are rejecting all requests returning non-200 response. If
the header does not return with `text/plain` we assume it is also an
invalid robots.txt.

We will have a difficult time using robotparser straight from Python's
standard library. The module does not return the content of robots.txt.
Subclassing the module may be trick as implementing based on its
""already-parse"" content is useless. I also want to give a try to
implement a real robots.txt parser according to Google's document
outlined in [1]. I believe the first version could just follow the
recommendation based on [2] and [3].
