<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst"">cryptography's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.3 - 2018-07-18</p>
<pre><code>
* **SECURITY ISSUE:**
  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.AEADDecryptionContext.finalize_with_tag`
  allowed tag truncation by default which can allow tag forgery in some cases.
  The method now enforces the ``min_tag_length`` provided to the
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.GCM` constructor.
  *CVE-2018-10903*
* Added support for Python 3.7.
* Added :meth:`~cryptography.fernet.Fernet.extract_timestamp` to get the
  authenticated timestamp of a :doc:`Fernet &lt;/fernet&gt;` token.
* Support for Python 2.7.x without ``hmac.compare_digest`` has been deprecated.
  We will require Python 2.7.7 or higher (or 2.7.6 on Ubuntu) in the next
  ``cryptography`` release.
* Fixed multiple issues preventing ``cryptography`` from compiling against
  LibreSSL 2.7.x.
* Added
  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.get_revoked_certificate_by_serial_number`
  for quick serial number searches in CRLs.
* The :class:`~cryptography.x509.RelativeDistinguishedName` class now
  preserves the order of attributes. Duplicate attributes now raise an error
  instead of silently discarding duplicates.
* :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.keywrap.aes_key_unwrap` and
  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.keywrap.aes_key_unwrap_with_padding`
  now raise :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.keywrap.InvalidUnwrap` if
  the wrapped key is an invalid length, instead of ``ValueError``.
<p>.. _v2-2-2:</p>
<p>2.2.2 - 2018-03-27
</code></pre></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Windows, macOS, and <code>manylinux1</code> wheels to be compiled with
OpenSSL 1.1.0h.</li>
</ul>
<p>.. _v2-2-1:</p>
<p>2.2.1 - 2018-03-20</p>
<pre><code>
* Reverted a change to ``GeneralNames`` which prohibited having zero elements,
  due to breakages.
* Fixed a bug in
  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.keywrap.aes_key_unwrap_with_padding`
  that caused it to raise ``InvalidUnwrap`` when key length modulo 8 was
  zero.
<p>.. _v2-2:
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; ... (truncated)

<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases"">flask's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>1.0</h2>
<p>The Pallets team is pleased to release Flask 1.0. [Read the announcement on our blog.](<a href=""https://www.palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-1-0-released/"">https://www.palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-1-0-released/</a></p>
<p>There are over a year's worth of changes in this release. Many features have been improved or changed. <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/changelog/"">Read the changelog</a> to understand how your project's code will be affected.</p>
<h2>JSON Security Fix</h2>
<p>Flask previously decoded incoming JSON bytes using the content type of the request. Although JSON should only be encoded as UTF-8, Flask was more lenient. However, Python includes non-text related encodings that could result in unexpected memory use by a request.</p>
<p>Flask will now detect the encoding of incoming JSON data as one of the supported UTF encodings, and will not allow arbitrary encodings from the request.</p>
<h2>Install or Upgrade</h2>
<p>Install from <a href=""https://pypi.org/project/Flask/"">PyPI</a> with pip:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -U Flask
</code></pre>
<h2>0.12.4</h2>
<p>This is a repackage of <a href=""https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/0.12.3"">0.12.3</a> to fix an issue with how the package was built.</p>
<h2>Upgrade</h2>
<p>Upgrade from <a href=""https://pypi.org/project/Flask/0.12.4/"">PyPI</a> with pip. Use a version identifier if you want to stay at 0.12:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -U 'Flask~=0.12.4'
</code></pre>
<h2>0.12.3</h2>
<p>This release includes an important security fix for JSON and a minor backport for CLI support in PyCharm. It is provided for projects that cannot update to Flask 1.0 immediately. See the <a href=""https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/flask-1-0-released"">1.0 announcement</a> and update to it instead if possible.</p>

from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
to debug.</li>
<li>Change the default for :data:<code>JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR</code> to
<code>False</code>. :func:<code>~json.jsonify</code> returns a compact format by
default, and an indented format in debug mode. :pr:<code>2193</code></li>
<li>:meth:<code>Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;</code> accepts the <code>host_matching</code>
argument and sets it on :attr:<code>~Flask.url_map</code>. :issue:<code>1559</code></li>

and passes it as the <code>host</code> argument when defining the static
route. :issue:<code>1559</code></li>
<li>:func:<code>send_file</code> supports Unicode in <code>attachment_filename</code>.
:pr:<code>2223</code></li>
<li>Pass <code>_scheme</code> argument from :func:<code>url_for</code> to
:meth:<code>~Flask.handle_url_build_error</code>. :pr:<code>2017</code></li>
<li>:meth:<code>~Flask.add_url_rule</code> accepts the
<code>provide_automatic_options</code> argument to disable adding the
<code>OPTIONS</code> method. :pr:<code>1489</code></li>
<li>:class:<code>~views.MethodView</code> subclasses inherit method handlers from
base classes. :pr:<code>1936</code></li>
<li>Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
request are handled by the app's error handlers. :pr:<code>2254</code></li>
<li>Blueprints gained :attr:<code>~Blueprint.json_encoder</code> and
:attr:<code>~Blueprint.json_decoder</code> attributes to override the app's
encoder and decoder. :pr:<code>1898</code></li>
<li>:meth:<code>Flask.make_response</code> raises <code>TypeError</code> instead of
<code>ValueError</code> for bad response types. The error messages have been
improved to describe why the type is invalid. :pr:<code>2256</code></li>
<li>Add <code>routes</code> CLI command to output routes registered on the
application. :pr:<code>2259</code></li>
<li>Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
Chrome. :pr:<code>2282</code></li>
<li>Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. :pr:<code>2282</code></li>
<li><code>SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN</code> is set if it is detected through
<code>SERVER_NAME</code>. :pr:<code>2282</code></li>
<li>Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called <code>create_app</code> or
<code>make_app</code> from <code>FLASK_APP</code>. :pr:<code>2297</code></li>

As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.
