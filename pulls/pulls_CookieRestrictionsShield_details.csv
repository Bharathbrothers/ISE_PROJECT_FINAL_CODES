As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

7,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/CookieRestrictionsShield/pulls/85,85,Attach survey telemetry to the page it was connected to.,"based on https://github.com/mozilla/FastBlockShield/pull/124

This introduces a new attribute on the tabInfo called
`payloadWaitingForSurvey`, which keeps a payload that is currently held
back from sending because the user still needs to respond to the reload
survey.

- `payloadWaitingForSurvey` sends on interaction with the survey, or on the next page refresh if the survey did not show up.
- If there is a `payloadWaitingForSurvey` waiting to send, and you close the tab, you will see 2 payloads sent

note: My tests fail at `5-reload-doorhanger.js line 171`, though they failed for the other PR too - could someone double check this please.

This is to avoid automatic refreshes that might come from page errors or other events on the page.

If the user has interacted with the page - clicked, entered data into an input etc - then on the next refresh (and subsequent refreshes) they have a chance of seeing the popup.

This flag gets reset on a navigate event - then they need to interact again to receive a chance of seeing the popup.

With an early exit tabInfo.reloadCount does not increment from these refreshes.

note: It hasn't been fully decided if we'd like to take this route yet
