0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/inventory/pulls/51,51,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #50


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

Inventory will error out if you try to create a zone (asign a new SOA to

create_zone behavior to create NS records for a zone's root domain
before assinging the new SOA record. This also means dns build jobs are
not scheduled when the NS records are added (because their domain
doesn't have a SOA yet) so the tests were also updated to reflect that
change."

This patch adds the following:
    * model introspection for search directives
    * inequality search operators
    * explicit strict equality and fuzzy equality search operators

We want users to be able to specify which fields on a model they want to
search. The syntax for specifying the field is shared with how django
annotates searches in Q objects (using '__' to specify traversing to a
related model.)

For example, say a user wanted to filter on systems with the status
'production'. They can now search:

    sys.system_status__name='production'

Internally, the compiler will parse the rhs to:

    directive -> 'sys'
    dattribute -> 'system_status__name'
    dvalue -> 'production'
    eq -> '='

It will then attempt to verify that 'system_status' corresponds to a
relational field on the 'sys' (System) class and that the model
referenced by 'system_status' (SystemStatus) has a field 'name'. If
things checkout the compiler will pass along a Q object for filtering
systems that looks like:

    Q(**{""system_status__name"": ""production""})

The following query is also now supported:

    sys.hostname~admin1 sys.server_model__vendor~HP \
        sys.purchase_date>=2014-01-01 sys.notes=""/foo ba[zr]""

This search does a fuzzy search for systems with ""admin1"" in their
hostname, selects for servers who's server model is supplied by vendors
with ""HP"" in their name, were purchased after (or equal to) January 1st
2014, and that atch the regular expression ""foo ba[zr]"""
