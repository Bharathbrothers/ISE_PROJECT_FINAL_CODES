This commit fixes the package.json, module paths, pre-push hook and docs to be compatible with jpm. It's important to note that this raises the minimum required Firefox version from 29 to 38. On the other hand, it makes working on Lightbeam easier as the documentation is easier to find*, it has a simpler installation procedure and it deals with unsigned add-ons out of the box (just some observations from a first-time add-on developer).

Just run `cfx run --e10s` and you won't see any requests being tracked by Lightbeam (tested in Developer Edition 42.0a2 and Nightly 44.0a1).

The problem is in the part where the tab for each HTTP request is figured out in `lib/tab/utils.js`. It tries to do that through the load context's topWindow, which is unavailable in multiprocess Firefox. It crashes when you try to access it:

`Exception... ""Component returned failure code: 0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED) [nsILoadContext.topWindow]""  nsresult: ""0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED)""  location: ""JS frame :: resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://jid1-f9uj2thwoam5gq-at-jetpack/lightbeam/lib/tab/utils.js :: getTabForChannel :: line 62""  data: no`

I fixed it by using loadContext.topFrameElement in browsers that support it, which gives us a chrome browser object which we can work with.

Note that `getTabForChannel2` (a fallback function for `getTabForChannel`) should still always fail in multiprocess. The [alternative](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox/Limitations_of_chrome_scripts#HTTP_requests suggested by MDN) needs a load context, and this function is a fallback for when no load context is available. I couldn't find out why the fallback was needed, so I left it alone.

All parameters (batch size, setTimeout delay) are chosen fairly arbitrarily, with some influence from [this article on yielding with JS timers](http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1506-yielding-with-javascript-timers/).

This works well on my Linux machine, but I ran into some issues testing it with my ""normal profile"". After digging around, it seems like there might be a bug elsewhere with the way we're deleting things to stay under quota (which I will try to look into more, later). In the meantime, I'm interested in hearing how smooth, fast, and janky-or-not things are on other platforms (since my Firefox on Linux doesn't have GPU support, the graph rendering is invariably janky).

444,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/lightbeam/pulls/108,108,Fix for Issue #6 (first attempt),"Hey Dethe,
Here's a first pass at a fix for bug 6. The tab.ready() listener now looks at the history of the tab -- if the last two sites are A and B, then it knows you navigated from A to B, and it adds the ""user_navigation"" datatype to that link. The grapher simply doesn't display any links with ""user_navigation"" as a datatype.

This is not strictly correct, since it's possible that something made a tracking connection between A and B AND the user manually navigated between them. The new behavior will be to not show the link, when really we would like to show it. But this is still better than nothing?

The way this is implemented is not the most elegant -- I had to dip into XPCOM to examine the tab history, and then interate through the simpleEnumerator to get all the items even though I only want the next-to-last one. If you know of a better way, I'm open to suggestions.

Manual test case: go to mozilla.com. Click the link to Twitter at the bottom of the page. Open the Collusion graph: observe there's no link from Mozilla to Twitter.

I've replaced the getDomain() function with direct calls to the service function getBaseDomainFromHost().

Previously a host like `node1.bbcimg.co.uk` would be found and the domain splitting would return `co.uk` instead of `bbcimg.co.uk`
