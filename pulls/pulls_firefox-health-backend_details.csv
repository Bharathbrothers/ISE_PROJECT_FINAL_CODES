> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add ""no-prototype-builtins"" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of ""properties that must be enumerable"".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the ""lookup""-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

> ## v4.1.2 - April 13th, 2019
> Chore/Test:
> - [#1515](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/pull/1515) - Port over linting and test for typings ([@&#8203;zimmi88](https://api.github.com/users/zimmi88))
> - chore: add missing typescript dependency, add package-lock.json - 594f1e3
> - test: remove safari from saucelabs - 871accc
> 
> Bugfixes: 
> - fix: prevent RCE through the ""lookup""-helper - cd38583
> 
> Compatibility notes:
> 
> Access to the constructor of a class thought `{{lookup obj ""constructor"" }}` is now prohibited. This closes 
> a leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.
> 
> This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described
> in [#1495](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). We will **not** increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, 
> and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version
> and the issue may not be resolved on many systems).

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

See the [Snyk test report](https://snyk.io/test/github/mozilla/firefox-health-backend?targetFile=package.json) for this project for details.

The PR includes:


- `package.json` scripts and a Snyk policy (`.snyk`) file, which patch the vulnerabilities that can't be upgraded away and ignore vulnerabilities with no fixes.

#### Vulnerabilities that will be fixed

##### With a [Snyk patch](https://snyk.io/docs/security/#snyk-s-process-for-creating-patches):
- [npm:tough-cookie:20170905](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:tough-cookie:20170905)

#### Vulnerabilities that will be ignored for 30 days

No sufficient upgrades or patches are available. You’ll receive an alert when more fixes are released.

- [npm:tunnel-agent:20170305](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:tunnel-agent:20170305)

Note that some vulnerabilities couldn’t be fully fixed and weren’t explicitly ignored, and so will still fail the Snyk test report.

You can read more about Snyk's upgrade and patch logic in [Snyk's documentation](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/).

We're refactoring the backend to use query parameters and use modeIds
to filter through the data returned by AWFY. This guarantees that if
the order of an array changes on AWFY we won't be grabbing data based on
the index of an array.

Instead of having multiples speedometer APIs you now call the speedometer API with
few parameters. For example:
http://localhost:3000/api/perf/benchmark/speedometer?channel=nightly&architecture=64

The data returned now has metadata regarding how it was generated. For example:
```json

      ""Chrome"": 3

By default, Mocha will no longer force the process to exit once all tests complete.
This means any test code (or code under test) which would normally prevent node
from exiting will do so when run in Mocha. Supply the --exit flag to revert
to pre-v4.0.0 behavior

In the future stop the server in the testing process rather than leaving it on.

Other changes:
* Remove mocha dependency as neutrino has its own"
