As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

Specific things to note: 
* resizing is done via a window resize function. Not the best (as it could fire for each and every pixel the size changes) and it breaks encapsulation (why should the plot know or care how big the window is?), but when SVG needs a raw pixel value to paint, you stop questioning and start doing. This method could work just as well for MG.js as it does for plotly.
* The ""doesn't crash when it renders"" test environment has insufficient DOM mocking for plotly (specifically it doesn't have object: uris), so the test mocks plotly completely out. This means we're not testing plotly, but that might be a good thing as plotly already tests plotly for us.
* All colours, label formats, titles, and so forth are just a first brush. Bikeshedding welcome.

And now the bigger note about Why Plotly and Not MG?

Trying to get MG to render histograms as categorical or boolean data as bar plots encountered the following problems:
bar plots require groups
bar plot examples on metricsgraphics.js don't work as written
bar plots with string axes labels error out
histograms with string x-axis values errors out
Even a log-linear plot looks strange for exponential data
MG's numerical/categorical inference is buggy if the accessor is broken

So I tried plotly and found it much better documented, supported by stackoverflow, and feature-rich for the application I was hoping to put it towards (plotting categorical and numerical bar charts, mostly).

I think I will continue to use Plotly for the prototype given the time constraints.

257,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mdv2-prototype/pulls/9,9,Add tentative view descriptions and icons.,"@chutten here's my first shot at giving the different views descriptions that may help with usage.

Let me know if there's anything you'd recommend adding or leaving out! 

The formatting isn't set in stone yet, but I do think it's best to have it automatically displayed on the page, rather than waiting for the user to click or hover over an icon. But it will definitely need some more styling to make it take up less space, I think.

Also, let me know what you think of the icons I've chosen. The icon for the summary view and comparison view are both tentative... they don't seem _quite_ right. I was thinking of something like [this](https://fontawesome.com/icons/list-alt?style=solid) for the summary view rather than the pie chart. But for comparison, I'm not sure.
