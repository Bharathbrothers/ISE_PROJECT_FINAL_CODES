As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

The goal of mine is to deploy for releng use by end of quarter, and iterate fast on filling in missing pieces.

What I expect to work by EOQ (checked items are ""works with this PR"")
- [x] Create a loan bug if one not specified
- [x] Create or reopen a tracking bug and link to loan bug
- [x] Select an inhouse machine if we don't preselect it. (using a dumb algorithm)
- [ ] Give us steps we manually need to select ""done"" on for manual parts, using links to wiki
- [x] crappy UI
- [ ] Releng able to manually enter ""current loans"" through UI.  (might actually be done, haven't tested lately)

Immediate next step for work after the above is all done and deployed is:
- [ ] Close out loan (currently just close bug, but might evolve to kill off AWS instance, file reimage bug, etc.)
