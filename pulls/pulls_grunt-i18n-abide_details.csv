<p align=""center"">
Have you heard the news?<br> <strong>ðŸ’€Node.js 0.10 is no longer maintainedðŸ’€</strong><br> 
Up until today it used to receive critical bug and security fixes, but these times are over for good.
<br><br><br>
</p>

![Node.js LTS schedule](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/908178/19853036/0ccd8570-9f67-11e6-9bfc-bbbc164c0702.png)



Node.js 0.10 is definitely not alive, but itâ€™s also not dead yet. Its ghost is still haunting the Node.js community ðŸ‘»  Many open source projects still support it, and yours is among them.
In order for the Node.js community to evolve we have to say goodbye to Node.js 0.10. Itâ€™s time for us to finally send it to the realm of the dead.

With this pull request I have removed all deprecated versions of Node.js from your project. I suggest supporting all versions of Node.js that are greater than 4 (Node.js 0.12 will be unmaintained by the end of the year as well). Please review this properly and help us to rout the Ghost of Node.js 0.10 ðŸ‘»ðŸ’€ Of course you can just close this pull request and keep supporting Node.js 0.10 â€¦ but â€¦ you have been warned â€¦ itâ€™s scary to deal with the living dead ðŸ˜¨ 


Good luck, your [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) Bot ðŸŽƒ

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of shelljs.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isnâ€™t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while Iâ€™m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of shelljs.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isnâ€™t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while Iâ€™m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This is the first automated pull requests to help reach the goal of up to date and stable software.
It updates all of the dependencies in the `package.json` in one go, but from now on youâ€™ll receive **pull requests** for each dependency update **in isolation and in real time**.

For updates that satisfy the existing version range youâ€™ll get pull-requests only if it breaks your build.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

When an update does not satisfy the existing range youâ€™ll get the pull request right away.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""

targets for itself. This can be for example the splitting of purely server-side
template translation strings and purely client-side translation strings. This is
in most cases to speed up translation delivery and overall speedcost created by
fetching overly large translation files that would otherwise contain server- and
client-side translations which is entirely unnecessairy bloat and only serves
to increase page-load-times. Also you may have seperate tools to extract gettext
information from your serverside code as from your client-side code.

Example here:
- server-side:
  - templates: nunjucks
  - translation extraction: i18n-abide translations using gettext()
  - builds: po/mo/js/json files for on the fly translation
- client-side:
  - templates: angular templates
  - translation extraction: angular-gettext with good integration into angularjs
  - builds: po/mo/js/json fils for translation post-download on the client

And so to ease the integration with the necessary client-side tools you'd need a
way to translate pot files from the extraction (in this case nggettext-extract)
into po files and then into javascript (here: nggettext-compile).

Note here that the abillity to create *.po-files has been left completely open
to the implementor and therefore needs tooling during build and to not double
the efforts of course.

grunt-i18n-abide basically is a great fit for that. This change only helping it to
become even better!

Like every other grunt-i18n-abide task abideCreate allows to define multiple
targets for itself. This can be for example the splitting of purely server-side
template translation strings and purely client-side translation strings. This is
in most cases to speed up translation delivery and overall speedcost created by
fetching overly large translation files that would otherwise contain server- and
client-side translations which is entirely unnecessairy bloat and only serves
to increase page-load-times. Also you may have seperate tools to extract gettext
information from your serverside code as from your client-side code.

Example here:

- server-side:
  - templates: nunjucks
  - translation extraction: i18n-abide translations using gettext()
  - builds: po/mo/js/json files for on the fly translation

- client-side:
  - templates: angular templates
  - translation extraction: angular-gettext with good integration into angularjs
  - builds: po/mo/js/json fils for translation post-download on the client

This branch renames `options.locales` to `options.languages` so that it's clearer a list of langs not locales should be supplied. E.g. a lang code is en-US whereas a locale for that code would be en_US.

Subsequently the locales are then created based on lang codes so en-US will result in the en_US locale.

At the same time I've cleaned up the repo references to point here and bumped the version.
