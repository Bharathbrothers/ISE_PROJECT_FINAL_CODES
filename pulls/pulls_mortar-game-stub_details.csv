1,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mortar-game-stub/pulls/9,9,"Scale Canvas to ""fullscreen"" with aspect ratio","Hi,

I've added a resize function and event listener to scale the canvas with correct aspect ration. I've set the canvas size to 320x480 (Portrait mode) initially. Maybe it's a small step towards [Issue #8](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-game-stub/issues/8) 

There are some more changes:
- Hint is now been shown as a overlay which could be hidden by click.
- Install button is positioned at the bottom and floats over the game canvas. 

The code is based on: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/optimizing-your-javascript-game-for-firefox-os/
