Notes from the commit log:

  ampersand app is barely functional but functional:

  Current working flow:
    1. `gulp` to start the server, surf to `localhost:9988`
    2. click any 'install' button to go to a detail page
    3. click 'install' on the detail page to toggle model state (locally)
      and send an install request to the addon
  Other notes:
    - alerting on the index page whenever an event is received from
      addon webchannel
    - we can replace the experiments collection use of
      ampersand-collection with ampersand-rest-collection when the
      experiment REST endpoint is ready
    - back/forward work (related: ampersand-view-switcher is pretty awesome)
    - hard refresh from non-root URL doesn't yet work
    - hogan + gulp = so much heartache, using mustache on the client for
      now
  Immediate follow-on items:
    - unreachable routes for settings and 404 page
    - fxa integration
    - templates/layout need attention
    - clearly need a base view for pages
    - tests need to happen :blush:
