- [x] Add supervisord conf to start fireplace and spartacus
- [ ] Add mkt stop command to stop supervisord
- [ ] Add docker-watch gulp command on fireplace so it builds the roll-up on changes.
- [ ] Check similar with Spartacus.

This will mean we drop 2 containers because the front-end projects are really wasted inside docker as all they do is build static files.

Fireplace and spartacus will be run under supervisord on the host (or you could run them manually)

This will improve the front-end story for the docker dev-env quite a bit.
## To try it

``` shell
mkt root $(mkt root)
fig build nginx
fig up -d # not mkt up
# Start supervisord
MKT_ROOT=$(mkt root) supervisord
```

To stop supervisord run:

`kill $(cat supervisord.pid)`

72,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/marketplace-env/pulls/24,24,WIP: move to a more configurable approach,"- mkt is now a command installed at setup
- the fig.yml.dist, images and base-images are all in the python package
- the trees all exist in one place, so still configurable as a file share
- the trees can be used if they already exist, no need to change anything

Example:

```
$ pip install marketplace-docker
$ mkt root ~/sandboxes/
Set the following environment variable: 
FIG_FILE=/Users/andy/.mkt.fig.yml

Saving root to /Users/andy/.wharfie
Written fig file to /Users/andy/.mkt.fig.yml
$ export FIG_FILE=/Users/andy/.mkt.fig.yml
$ fig up spartacus
Recreating andy_spartacus_1...
Attaching to andy_spartacus_1
```

Looking for general feedback, there's cleaning and so on to do here. 

The thing I like is that things like checkout still work, the fig file is now templated, existing devs can setup docker really quickly because they point at their existing checkout and `mkt` and `fig` are now global without having to mess around inside wharfie.

87,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/marketplace-env/pulls/9,9,Fix checkout command (bug 1058536),"This fixes checkout to use the moz repos as the clone source.
It defaults to calling moz repos `upstream` and forks `origin` you can override this with command args.

e.g: default command usage would be:

`bin/mkt checkout`

For people with inverted upstream/origin this would work:

`bin/mkt checkout --moz_remote_name=origin --fork_remote_name=upstream`

This also makes sure the branch.master.origin setting in the local repo is set to match your fork (so the default for push is sane)

Lastly there's a new command to check the trees setup.

`bin/mkt chkgitconfig`

Here's example output (This is with inverted upstream/origin - which isn't the default)
