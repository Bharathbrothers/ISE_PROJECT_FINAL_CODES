90,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/minion-frontend/pulls/111,111,Fixed #109. Dashboard has a <select> to choose which group to view. ,"First, this commit requires https://github.com/mozilla/minion-backend/issues/215
to be fixed and commits to be pulled in.

This commit has several important changes:

**HomeController is rewritten**
I have a problem with the original code. I need to save the promise
to be able to kill in-progress $timeout. Once I factored out I also
experienced multiple requests were fired concurrently. I believe
this issue would have been fixed by applying the fix below, but
since I already rewrote I am not going to bother verify my theory.

**Remove controller from $routeProvider's when(..)**
In `minion-main.js` we specify some routes and for each when(..)
case we specify the controller. I started out with a new controller
called `Ctrl` and then once the new controller was completed,
I changed it back to `HomeController`. I then noticed two
requests were made. My theory was the controller was called twice
and I was right. I reduced to a single index.html and a single
controller. A quick googling yield https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/angular/pXQrhrL84Xc
.

The fix is to remove controller from the when().

**Add a ""Loading data.... cloak**
When we move away from one group to another there is a 2.5 second of wait time,
I introduced a simple ""Loading data"" visual (demo: just look at how
http://plnkr.co/ did it).

**Allow group selection in the dashboard view**
This is the original task of this ticket.

**Thoughts**
This ticket took me a long time. A total of two days of efforts to find all kinds of
problems in how we use angularJS. I am hoping in the upcoming weeks I can
improve my angularJS skill.

91,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/minion-frontend/pulls/111,111,Fixed #109. Dashboard has a <select> to choose which group to view. ,"First, this commit requires https://github.com/mozilla/minion-backend/issues/215
to be fixed and commits to be pulled in.

This commit has several important changes:

**HomeController is rewritten**
I have a problem with the original code. I need to save the promise
to be able to kill in-progress $timeout. Once I factored out I also
experienced multiple requests were fired concurrently. I believe
this issue would have been fixed by applying the fix below, but
since I already rewrote I am not going to bother verify my theory.

**Remove controller from $routeProvider's when(..)**
In `minion-main.js` we specify some routes and for each when(..)
case we specify the controller. I started out with a new controller
called `Ctrl` and then once the new controller was completed,
I changed it back to `HomeController`. I then noticed two
requests were made. My theory was the controller was called twice
and I was right. I reduced to a single index.html and a single
controller. A quick googling yield https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/angular/pXQrhrL84Xc
.

The fix is to remove controller from the when().

**Add a ""Loading data.... cloak**
When we move away from one group to another there is a 2.5 second of wait time,
I introduced a simple ""Loading data"" visual (demo: just look at how
http://plnkr.co/ did it).

**Allow group selection in the dashboard view**
This is the original task of this ticket.

**Thoughts**
This ticket took me a long time. A total of two days of efforts to find all kinds of
problems in how we use angularJS. I am hoping in the upcoming weeks I can
improve my angularJS skill.

decided it makes sense to do some refactoring here, to make the templates more
DRY, and provide sanity moving forward. Primary adjustments are:
- Compile all routes into an app.navItems variable
- Introduce app.navContext, allowing us to easily get the navigation
  items for a specific ""section"" of the site
- Adjust the controller to contain more variables that are useful
  in rendering a nav.

I am completely new to AngularJS, infact -- this is the first time I ever
touched it! So, there are some issues. For example, in `AdminGroupController`
we need a sub nav for the ""Group Editor"". The implementation of adding
this to the nav feels very hackish and perhaps we can implement
some notion of sub navigation. However, this may not be required right now
given the simplicity of the admin, so perhaps it's ok for the current
implementation.

Either way, happy to hear your feedback on this, and what I can improve on before merge. :)
