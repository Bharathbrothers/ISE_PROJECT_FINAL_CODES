0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozcommitbuilder/pulls/18,18,Make default shellCacheDir hidden on Linux/OS X,"I don't see much need to clutter people's home directory with the moz-commitbuilder-cache so I suggest that it is prefixed with a '.' so that it is hidden on Linux/OS X.  This patch provides a migration path for existing users by first checking if ~/moz-commitbuilder-cache exists and using that. Otherwise, it defaults to ~/.moz-commitbuilder-cache for shellCacheDir.

FirefoxRunner (and all other runners from mozrunner) expect the first argument to be a profile. We don't need to specify any if we use Runner.create(). Not 100% sure that's the right fix but this makes me able to bisect again.
