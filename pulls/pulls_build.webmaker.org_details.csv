**Why?**

I couldn't get the server to run locally ( #65 ) in my dev environment. I believe @simonwex was seeing the same issue. 

**What?**
- I replaced `gulp-express` with `gulp-live-server` because that was what `gulp-express` [recommends](https://github.com/gimm/gulp-express). 
- This showed me errors which allowed me to get the app running (needed a Firebase key)
- It also started the server! (Even after fixing the Firebase error, I couldn't get `gulp-express` to work again)
- So, if people who know more about these things than me are happy, this seems to work

**Also**
- Just to check. Should I be committing those two build files?
