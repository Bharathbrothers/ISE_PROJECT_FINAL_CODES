### Detected Package Files

 * `Cargo.toml` (cargo)
 * `.circleci/config.yml` (circleci)
 * `Dockerfile` (dockerfile)

### Configuration Summary

Based on the default config's presets, Renovate will:

  - Start dependency updates only once this Configure Renovate PR is merged
  - Separate major versions of dependencies into individual branches/PRs
  - Do not separate patch and minor upgrades into separate PRs for the same dependency
  - Upgrade to unstable versions only if the existing version is unstable
  - Raise PRs immediately (after branch is created)
  - Use <code>renovate/</code> as prefix for all branch names
  - If semantic commits detected, use semantic commit type <code>fix</code> for dependencies and <code>chore</code> for all others
  - Keep existing branches updated even when not scheduled
  - Disable automerging feature - wait for humans to merge all PRs
  - Ignore `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `vendor` and various test/tests directories
  - Update existing lock files only when <code>package.json</code> is modified
  - Autodetect whether to pin dependencies or maintain ranges
  - Rate limit PR creation to a maximum of two per hour
  - Limit to maximum 20 open PRs at any time
  - Group known monorepo packages together
  - Use curated list of recommended non-monorepo package groupings
