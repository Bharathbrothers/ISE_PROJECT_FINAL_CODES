<details>
<summary>Vulnerabilities fixed</summary>

*Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.*

> **High severity vulnerability that affects urllib3**
> The urllib3 library before 1.24.2 for Python mishandles certain cases where the desired set of CA certificates is different from the OS store of CA certificates, which results in SSL connections succeeding in situations where a verification failure is the correct outcome. This is related to use of the ssl_context, ca_certs, or ca_certs_dir argument.

> 1.24.2 (2019-04-17)
> ===================
> 
> -   Don't load system certificates by default when any other `ca_certs`, `ca_certs_dir` or `ssl_context` parameters are specified.
> -   Remove Authorization header regardless of case when redirecting to cross-site. (Issue [\#1510](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/\1510))

As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

> Release 2.0.0 (released Mar 29, 2019)
> =====================================
> 
> Dependencies
> ------------
> 
> 2.0.0b1
> 
> * LaTeX builder now depends on TeX Live 2015 or above.
> * LaTeX builder (with ``'pdflatex'`` :confval:`latex_engine`) will process
>   Unicode Greek letters in text (not in math mark-up) via the text font and
>   will not escape them to math mark-up. See the discussion of the
>   ``'fontenc'`` key of :confval:`latex_elements`; such (optional) support for
>   Greek adds, for example on Ubuntu xenial, the ``texlive-lang-greek`` and (if
>   default font set-up is not modified) ``cm-super(-minimal)`` as additional
>   Sphinx LaTeX requirements.
> * LaTeX builder with :confval:`latex_engine` set to ``'xelatex'`` or to
>   ``'lualatex'`` requires (by default) the ``FreeFont`` fonts,
>   which in Ubuntu xenial are provided by package ``fonts-freefont-otf``, and
>   e.g. in Fedora 29 via package ``texlive-gnu-freefont``.
> * requests 2.5.0 or above
> * The six package is no longer a dependency
> * The sphinxcontrib-websupport package is no longer a dependency
> * Some packages are separated to sub packages:
> 
>   - sphinxcontrib.applehelp
>   - sphinxcontrib.devhelp
>   - sphinxcontrib.htmlhelp
>   - sphinxcontrib.jsmath
>   - sphinxcontrib.serializinghtml
>   - sphinxcontrib.qthelp
> 
> Incompatible changes
> --------------------
> 
> 2.0.0b1
> 
> * Drop python 2.7 and 3.4 support
> * Drop docutils 0.11 support
> * Drop features and APIs deprecated in 1.7.x
> * The default setting for :confval:`master_doc` is changed to ``'index'`` which
>   has been longly used as default of sphinx-quickstart.
> * LaTeX: Move message resources to ``sphinxmessage.sty``
> * LaTeX: Stop using ``\captions<lang>`` macro for some labels
> * LaTeX: for ``'xelatex'`` and ``'lualatex'``, use the ``FreeFont`` OpenType
>   fonts as default choice (refs: [#5645](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/5645))
> * LaTeX: ``'xelatex'`` and ``'lualatex'`` now use ``\small`` in code-blocks
>   (due to ``FreeMono`` character width) like ``'pdflatex'`` already did (due
>   to ``Courier`` character width).  You may need to adjust this via
>   :confval:`latex_elements` ``'fvset'`` key, in case of usage of some other
></tr></table> ... (truncated)

   ### 3.6.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed a bug where stdout and stderr were logged twice by junitxml when a test
  was marked xfail. (`3491
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3491&gt;`_)

- Fix ``usefixtures`` mark applyed to unittest tests by correctly instantiating
  ``FixtureInfo``. (`3498
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3498&gt;`_)

- Fix assertion rewriter compatibility with libraries that monkey patch
  ``file`` objects. (`3503
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3503&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Added a section on how to use fixtures as factories to the fixture
  documentation. (`3461 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3461&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Enable caching for pip/pre-commit in order to reduce build time on
  travis/appveyor. (`3502
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3502&gt;`_)

- Switch pytest to the src/ layout as we already suggested it for good practice
  - now we implement it as well. (`3513
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3513&gt;`_)

- Fix if in tests to support 3.7.0b5, where a docstring handling in AST got
  reverted. (`3530 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3530&gt;`_)

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **3.5.1** to **3.6.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.6.0
   ```
   =========================

Features
--------

- Revamp the internals of the ``pytest.mark`` implementation with correct per
  node handling which fixes a number of long standing bugs caused by the old
  design. This introduces new ``Node.iter_markers(name)`` and
  ``Node.get_closest_mark(name)`` APIs. Users are **strongly encouraged** to
  read the `reasons for the revamp in the docs
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.htmlmarker-revamp-and-iteration&gt;`_,
  or jump over to details about `updating existing code to use the new APIs
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.htmlupdating-code&gt;`_. (`3317
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3317&gt;`_)

- Now when ``pytest.fixture`` is applied more than once to the same function a
  ``ValueError`` is raised. This buggy behavior would cause surprising problems
  and if was working for a test suite it was mostly by accident. (`2334
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2334&gt;`_)

- Support for Python 3.7&#39;s builtin ``breakpoint()`` method, see `Using the
  builtin breakpoint function
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlbreakpoint-builtin&gt;`_ for
  details. (`3180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3180&gt;`_)

- ``monkeypatch`` now supports a ``context()`` function which acts as a context
  manager which undoes all patching done within the ``with`` block. (`3290
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3290&gt;`_)

- The ``--pdb`` option now causes KeyboardInterrupt to enter the debugger,
  instead of stopping the test session. On python 2.7, hitting CTRL+C again
  exits the debugger. On python 3.2 and higher, use CTRL+D. (`3299
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3299&gt;`_)

- pytest not longer changes the log level of the root logger when the
  ``log-level`` parameter has greater numeric value than that of the level of
  the root logger, which makes it play better with custom logging configuration
  in user code. (`3307 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3307&gt;`_)


Bug Fixes
---------

- A rare race-condition which might result in corrupted ``.pyc`` files on
  Windows has been hopefully solved. (`3008
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3008&gt;`_)

- Also use iter_marker for discovering the marks applying for marker
  expressions from the cli to avoid the bad data from the legacy mark storage.
  (`3441 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3441&gt;`_)

- When showing diffs of failed assertions where the contents contain only
  whitespace, escape them using ``repr()`` first to make it easy to spot the
  differences. (`3443 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3443&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Change documentation copyright year to a range which auto-updates itself each
  time it is published. (`3303
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3303&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- ``pytest`` now depends on the `python-atomicwrites
  &lt;https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites&gt;`_ library. (`3008
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3008&gt;`_)

- Update all pypi.python.org URLs to pypi.org. (`3431
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3431&gt;`_)

- Detect `pytest_` prefixed hooks using the internal plugin manager since
  ``pluggy`` is deprecating the ``implprefix`` argument to ``PluginManager``.
  (`3487 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3487&gt;`_)

- Import ``Mapping`` and ``Sequence`` from ``_pytest.compat`` instead of
  directly from ``collections`` in ``python_api.py::approx``. Add ``Mapping``
  to ``_pytest.compat``, import it from ``collections`` on python 2, but from
  ``collections.abc`` on Python 3 to avoid a ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python
  3.7 or newer. (`3497 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3497&gt;`_)

   ### 0.2.5
   ```
   .. code:: python

    html_theme = &quot;sphinx_rtd_theme&quot;

Via git or download
-------------------

Symlink or subtree the ``sphinx_rtd_theme/sphinx_rtd_theme`` repository into your documentation at
``docs/_themes/sphinx_rtd_theme`` then add the following two settings to your Sphinx
``conf.py`` file:

.. code:: python

    html_theme = &quot;sphinx_rtd_theme&quot;
    html_theme_path = [&quot;_themes&quot;, ]

Configuration
=============

You can configure different parts of the theme.

Project-wide configuration
--------------------------

The theme&#39;s project-wide options are defined in the ``sphinx_rtd_theme/theme.conf``
file of this repository, and can be defined in your project&#39;s ``conf.py`` via
``html_theme_options``. For example:

.. code:: python

    html_theme_options = {
        &#39;typekit_id&#39;: hiw1hhg,
        &#39;canonical_url&#39;:
        &#39;analytics_id&#39;:
        &#39;collapse_navigation&#39;: False
        &#39;sticky_navigation&#39;: False
        &#39;navigation_depth&#39;: 4
        &#39;includehidden&#39;: True
        &#39;logo_only&#39;:
        &#39;display_version&#39;: True
        &#39;prev_next_buttons_location&#39;: bottom
    }

The following options are available:

* ``canonical_url`` This will specify a `canonical url &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element&gt;`__
  to let search engines know they should give higher ranking to latest version of the docs.
  The url points to the root of the documentation and requires a trailing slash.
* ``includehidden`` Specifies if the global toctree includes toctrees marked with the `:hidden:` option
* ``prev_next_buttons_location`` can take the value ``bottom``, ``top``, ``both`` , or ``None``
  and will display the &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; buttons accordingly

Page-level configuration
------------------------

Pages support metadata that changes how the theme renders.
You can currently add the following:

* ``:github_url:`` This will force the &quot;Edit on GitHub&quot; to the configured URL
* ``:bitbucket_url:`` This will force the &quot;Edit on Bitbucket&quot; to the configured URL
* ``:gitlab_url:`` This will force the &quot;Edit on GitLab&quot; to the configured URL

Changelog
=========

master
------

* Include fontawesome-webfont.woff2 in pip package
* Updated wyrm_ and Font Awesome
* Split multiple data types on different lines
* Italicize ``.versionmodified``
* Fix line number spacing to align with the code lines
* Hide Edit links on auto created pages
* Align ``.. centered::`` text to the center
* Increase contrast for footnotes
* Add language to the JS output variable
* Include the lato italics font with the theme
* Fix padding on field lists
* Add setuptools entry point allowing to use ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` as
  Sphinx ``html_theme`` directly.
   ```

>- Move import of ``doctest.UnexpectedException`` to top-level to avoid possible
>  errors when using ``--pdb``. (`1810
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1810&gt;`_)

>  test which was giving false negatives about output capturing. (`3052
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3052&gt;`_)

>- Fix ordering of tests using parametrized fixtures which can lead to fixtures
>  being created more than necessary. (`3161
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3161&gt;`_)

>- Fix bug where logging happening at hooks outside of &quot;test run&quot; hooks would
>  cause an internal error. (`3184
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3184&gt;`_)

>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3206&gt;`_)

>- Errors shown when a ``pytest.raises()`` with ``match=`` fails are now cleaner
>  on what happened: When no exception was raised, the &quot;matching &#39;...&#39;&quot; part got
>  removed as it falsely implies that an exception was raised but it didn&#39;t

There's a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.
You are currently using **3.3.2**. I have updated it to **3.4.0**

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.4.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- All pytest classes now subclass ``object`` for better Python 2/3 compatibility.
>  This should not affect user code except in very rare edge cases. (`2147
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147&gt;`_)


>Features
>--------

>- Introduce ``empty_parameter_set_mark`` ini option to select which mark to
>  apply when ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` is given an empty set of parameters.
>  Valid options are ``skip`` (default) and ``xfail``. Note that it is planned
>  to change the default to ``xfail`` in future releases as this is considered
>  less error prone. (`2527
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2527&gt;`_)

>- **Incompatible change**: after community feedback the `logging
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_ functionality has
>  undergone some changes. Please consult the `logging documentation
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.htmlincompatible-changes-in-pytest-3-4&gt;`_
>  for details. (`3013 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3013&gt;`_)

>- Console output falls back to &quot;classic&quot; mode when capturing is disabled (``-s``),
>  otherwise the output gets garbled to the point of being useless. (`3038
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3038&gt;`_)

>- New `pytest_runtest_logfinish
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_logfinish&gt;`_
>  hook which is called when a test item has finished executing, analogous to
>  `pytest_runtest_logstart
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_start&gt;`_.
>  (`3101 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3101&gt;`_)

>- Improve performance when collecting tests using many fixtures. (`3107
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3107&gt;`_)

>- New ``caplog.get_records(when)`` method which provides access to the captured
>  records for the ``&quot;setup&quot;``, ``&quot;call&quot;`` and ``&quot;teardown&quot;``
>  testing stages. (`3117 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3117&gt;`_)

>- New fixture ``record_xml_attribute`` that allows modifying and inserting
>  attributes on the ``&lt;testcase&gt;`` xml node in JUnit reports. (`3130
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3130&gt;`_)

>- The default cache directory has been renamed from ``.cache`` to
>  ``.pytest_cache`` after community feedback that the name ``.cache`` did not
>  make it clear that it was used by pytest. (`3138
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3138&gt;`_)

>- Colorize the levelname column in the live-log output. (`3142
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3142&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix hanging pexpect test on MacOS by using flush() instead of wait().
>  (`2022 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2022&gt;`_)

>- Fix restoring Python state after in-process pytest runs with the
>  ``pytester`` plugin; this may break tests using multiple inprocess
>  pytest runs if later ones depend on earlier ones leaking global interpreter
>  changes. (`3016 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3016&gt;`_)

>- Fix skipping plugin reporting hook when test aborted before plugin setup
>  hook. (`3074 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3074&gt;`_)

>- Fix progress percentage reported when tests fail during teardown. (`3088
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3088&gt;`_)

>- **Incompatible change**: ``-o/--override`` option no longer eats all the
>  remaining options, which can lead to surprising behavior: for example,
>  ``pytest -o foo=1 /path/to/test.py`` would fail because ``/path/to/test.py``
>  would be considered as part of the ``-o`` command-line argument. One
>  consequence of this is that now multiple configuration overrides need
>  multiple ``-o`` flags: ``pytest -o foo=1 -o bar=2``. (`3103
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3103&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Document hooks (defined with ``historic=True``) which cannot be used with
>  ``hookwrapper=True``. (`2423
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2423&gt;`_)

>- Clarify that warning capturing doesn&#39;t change the warning filter by default.
>  (`2457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2457&gt;`_)

>- Clarify a possible confusion when using pytest_fixture_setup with fixture
>  functions that return None. (`2698
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2698&gt;`_)

>- Fix the wording of a sentence on doctest flags used in pytest. (`3076
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3076&gt;`_)

>- Prefer ``https://*.readthedocs.io`` over ``http://*.rtfd.org`` for links in
>  the documentation. (`3092
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3092&gt;`_)

>- Improve readability (wording, grammar) of Getting Started guide (`3131
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3131&gt;`_)

>- Added note that calling pytest.main multiple times from the same process is
>  not recommended because of import caching. (`3143
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3143&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Show a simple and easy error when keyword expressions trigger a syntax error
>  (for example, ``&quot;-k foo and import&quot;`` will show an error that you can not use
>  the ``import`` keyword in expressions). (`2953
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2953&gt;`_)

>- Change parametrized automatic test id generation to use the ``__name__``
>  attribute of functions instead of the fallback argument name plus counter.
>  (`2976 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2976&gt;`_)

>- Replace py.std with stdlib imports. (`3067
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3067&gt;`_)

>- Corrected &#39;you&#39; to &#39;your&#39; in logging docs. (`3129
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3129&gt;`_)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.3.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions
>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on
>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we
>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users
>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)

>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the
>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2236
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2236&gt;`_)

>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken
>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal
>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)

>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack
>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)

>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it
>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>Features
>--------

>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``
>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available
>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and
>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``
>  declarations on functions. (`2267
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)

>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)

>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The
>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``
>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)

>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)

>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.
>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options
>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using
>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test
>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).
>  For more information, please see the `logging docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was
>  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog
>  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch
>  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the
>  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has
>  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)

>- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the
>  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)

>- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)

>- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and
>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879

>- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.
>  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)

>- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now
>  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the
>  original traceback. In python2 it will show the original traceback with a new
>  message that explains in which plugin. In python3 it will show 2 canonized
>  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an
>  exception that PyTest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)

>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)

>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to
>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)

>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its
>  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``
>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and
>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)

>- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being
>  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,
>  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation
>  for safety. (`2809 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2809&gt;`_)

>- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from
>  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (`2845
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2845&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which
>  should not be rewritten. (`2939
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2939&gt;`_)

>- Handle marks without description in ``pytest.ini``. (`2942
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2942&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- pytest now depends on `attrs &lt;https://pypi.org/project/attrs/&gt;`_ for internal
>  structures to ease code maintainability. (`2641
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2641&gt;`_)

>- Refactored internal Python 2/3 compatibility code to use ``six``. (`2642
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2642&gt;`_)

>- Stop vendoring ``pluggy`` - we&#39;re missing out on its latest changes for not
>  much benefit (`2719 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2719&gt;`_)

>- Internal refactor: simplify ascii string escaping by using the
>  backslashreplace error handler in newer Python 3 versions. (`2734
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2734&gt;`_)

>- Remove unnecessary mark evaluator in unittest plugin (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>- Calls to ``Metafunc.addcall`` now emit a deprecation warning. This function
>  is scheduled to be removed in ``pytest-4.0``. (`2876
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2876&gt;`_)

>- Internal move of the parameterset extraction to a more maintainable place.
>  (`2877 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2877&gt;`_)

>- Internal refactoring to simplify scope node lookup. (`2910

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.1.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
>  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
>  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
>  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (2430)

>- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (2434)

>- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (2436)

>- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
>  context manager form. (2441)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (2390)




>### 3.1.0

>==================


>New Features
>------------

>* The ``pytest-warnings`` plugin has been integrated into the core and now ``pytest`` automatically
>  captures and displays warnings at the end of the test session.

>  .. warning::

>    This feature may disrupt test suites which apply and treat warnings themselves, and can be
>    disabled in your ``pytest.ini``:

>    .. code-block:: ini

>      [pytest]
>      addopts = -p no:warnings

>    See the `warnings documentation page &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html&gt;`_ for more
>    information.

>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Added ``junit_suite_name`` ini option to specify root ``&lt;testsuite&gt;`` name for JUnit XML reports (`533`_).

>* Added an ini option ``doctest_encoding`` to specify which encoding to use for doctest files.
>  Thanks `wheerd`_ for the PR (`2101`_).

>* ``pytest.warns`` now checks for subclass relationship rather than
>  class equality. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR (`2166`_)

>* ``pytest.raises`` now asserts that the error message matches a text or regex
>  with the ``match`` keyword argument. Thanks `Kriechi`_ for the PR.

>* ``pytest.param`` can be used to declare test parameter sets with marks and test ids.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>Changes
>-------

>* remove all internal uses of pytest_namespace hooks,
>  this is to prepare the removal of preloadconfig in pytest 4.0
>  Thanks to `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.

>* pytest now warns when a callable ids raises in a parametrized test. Thanks `fogo`_ for the PR.

>* It is now possible to skip test classes from being collected by setting a
>  ``__test__`` attribute to ``False`` in the class body (`2007`_). Thanks
>  to `syre`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Change junitxml.py to produce reports that comply with Junitxml schema.
>  If the same test fails with failure in call and then errors in teardown
>  we split testcase element into two, one containing the error and the other
>  the failure. (`2228`_) Thanks to `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Testcase reports with a ``url`` attribute will now properly write this to junitxml.
>  Thanks `fushi`_ for the PR (`1874`_).

>* Remove common items from dict comparision output when verbosity=1. Also update
>  the truncation message to make it clearer that pytest truncates all
>  assertion messages if verbosity &lt; 2 (`1512`_).
>  Thanks `mattduck`_ for the PR

>* ``--pdbcls`` no longer implies ``--pdb``. This makes it possible to use
>  ``addopts=--pdbcls=module.SomeClass`` on ``pytest.ini``. Thanks `davidszotten`_ for
>  the PR (`1952`_).

>* fix `2013`_: turn RecordedWarning into ``namedtuple``,
>  to give it a comprehensible repr while preventing unwarranted modification.

>* fix `2208`_: ensure a iteration limit for _pytest.compat.get_real_func.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and PR.

>* Hooks are now verified after collection is complete, rather than right after loading installed plugins. This
>  makes it easy to write hooks for plugins which will be loaded during collection, for example using the

There's a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.
You are currently using **3.0.7**. I have updated it to **3.1.1**

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.1.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
>  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
>  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
>  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (2430)

>- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (2434)

>- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (2436)

>- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
>  context manager form. (2441)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (2390)




>### 3.1.0

>==================


>New Features
>------------

>* The ``pytest-warnings`` plugin has been integrated into the core and now ``pytest`` automatically
>  captures and displays warnings at the end of the test session.

>  .. warning::

>    This feature may disrupt test suites which apply and treat warnings themselves, and can be
>    disabled in your ``pytest.ini``:

>    .. code-block:: ini

>      [pytest]
>      addopts = -p no:warnings

>    See the `warnings documentation page &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html&gt;`_ for more
>    information.

>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Added ``junit_suite_name`` ini option to specify root ``&lt;testsuite&gt;`` name for JUnit XML reports (`533`_).

>* Added an ini option ``doctest_encoding`` to specify which encoding to use for doctest files.
>  Thanks `wheerd`_ for the PR (`2101`_).

>* ``pytest.warns`` now checks for subclass relationship rather than
>  class equality. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR (`2166`_)

>* ``pytest.raises`` now asserts that the error message matches a text or regex
>  with the ``match`` keyword argument. Thanks `Kriechi`_ for the PR.

>* ``pytest.param`` can be used to declare test parameter sets with marks and test ids.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>Changes
>-------

>* remove all internal uses of pytest_namespace hooks,
>  this is to prepare the removal of preloadconfig in pytest 4.0
>  Thanks to `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.

>* pytest now warns when a callable ids raises in a parametrized test. Thanks `fogo`_ for the PR.

>* It is now possible to skip test classes from being collected by setting a
>  ``__test__`` attribute to ``False`` in the class body (`2007`_). Thanks
>  to `syre`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Change junitxml.py to produce reports that comply with Junitxml schema.
>  If the same test fails with failure in call and then errors in teardown
>  we split testcase element into two, one containing the error and the other
>  the failure. (`2228`_) Thanks to `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Testcase reports with a ``url`` attribute will now properly write this to junitxml.
>  Thanks `fushi`_ for the PR (`1874`_).

>* Remove common items from dict comparision output when verbosity=1. Also update
>  the truncation message to make it clearer that pytest truncates all
>  assertion messages if verbosity &lt; 2 (`1512`_).
>  Thanks `mattduck`_ for the PR

>* ``--pdbcls`` no longer implies ``--pdb``. This makes it possible to use
>  ``addopts=--pdbcls=module.SomeClass`` on ``pytest.ini``. Thanks `davidszotten`_ for
>  the PR (`1952`_).

>* fix `2013`_: turn RecordedWarning into ``namedtuple``,
>  to give it a comprehensible repr while preventing unwarranted modification.

>* fix `2208`_: ensure a iteration limit for _pytest.compat.get_real_func.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and PR.

>* Hooks are now verified after collection is complete, rather than right after loading installed plugins. This
>  makes it easy to write hooks for plugins which will be loaded during collection, for example using the
>  ``pytest_plugins`` special variable (`1821`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Modify ``pytest_make_parametrize_id()`` hook to accept ``argname`` as an
>  additional parameter.
>  Thanks `unsignedint`_ for the PR.

>* Add ``venv`` to the default ``norecursedirs`` setting.
>  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the PR.

>* ``PluginManager.import_plugin`` now accepts unicode plugin names in Python 2.
>  Thanks `reutsharabani`_ for the PR.

>* fix `2308`_: When using both ``--lf`` and ``--ff``, only the last failed tests are run.
>  Thanks `ojii`_ for the PR.

>* Replace minor/patch level version numbers in the documentation with placeholders.
>  This significantly reduces change-noise as different contributors regnerate
>  the documentation on different platforms.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.

>* fix `2391`_: consider pytest_plugins on all plugin modules
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.7

>==================


>* Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules silently discarding
>  other modules when importing fails
>  Notably, importing the `anydbm` module is fixed. (`2248`_).
>  Thanks `pfhayes`_ for the PR.

>* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occured twice per testcase
>  element in the XML report. Thanks `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.
>  
>* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`2238`_).
>  Thanks `sirex`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to `PEP-479`_ (`2160`_).

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
>  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
>  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks `barneygale`_ for the
>  PR.

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.5

>=====

>* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (`2105`_).
>  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to `mbukatov`_ for the report and
>  `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
>  and filenames, respectively (`2089`_ and `2078`_). Thanks to `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (`478`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (`687`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
>  Thanks to `dupuy`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``&quot;4 +- 4.0e-06&quot;``)
>  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
>  which can result in bugs such as `2111`_. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``±`` (for example ``4 ± 4.0e-06``).
>  Thanks `kerrick-lyft`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
>  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (`2034`_).
>  Thanks `nmundar`_ for the PR.

>* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (`2082`_).
>  Thanks `adler-j`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
>  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
>  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (`2016`_).
>  Thanks `d-b-w`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
>  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
>  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(`2103`_).
>  Thanks `jaraco`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (`2038`_). Thanks
>  `nedbat`_.
