<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/pytest-dev/py/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst"">py's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>1.10.0 (2020-12-12)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fix a regular expression DoS vulnerability in the py.path.svnwc SVN blame functionality (CVE-2020-29651)</li>
<li>Update vendored apipkg: 1.4 =&gt; 1.5</li>
<li>Update vendored iniconfig: 1.0.0 =&gt; 1.1.1</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.9.0 (2020-06-24)</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add type annotation stubs for the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>py.error</code></li>
<li><code>py.iniconfig</code></li>
<li><code>py.path</code> (not including SVN paths)</li>
<li><code>py.io</code></li>
<li><code>py.xml</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There are no plans to type other modules at this time.</p>
<p>The type annotations are provided in external .pyi files, not inline in the
code, and may therefore contain small errors or omissions. If you use <code>py</code>
in conjunction with a type checker, and encounter any type errors you believe
should be accepted, please report it in an issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.8.2 (2020-06-15)</h1>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, <code>py.path.local</code>s which differ only in case now have the same
Python hash value. Previously, such paths were considered equal but had
different hashes, which is not allowed and breaks the assumptions made by
dicts, sets and other users of hashes.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.8.1 (2019-12-27)</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Handle <code>FileNotFoundError</code> when trying to import pathlib in <code>path.common</code>
on Python 3.4 (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/py/issues/207"">#207</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>py.path.local.samefile</code> now works correctly in Python 3 on Windows when dealing with symlinks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.8.0 (2019-02-21)</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>add <code>&quot;importlib&quot;</code> pyimport mode for python3.5+, allowing unimportable test suites
to contain identically named modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fix <code>LocalPath.as_cwd()</code> not calling <code>os.chdir()</code> with <code>None</code>, when
being invoked from a non-existing directory.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md"">rsa's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Version 4.1 - released 2020-06-10</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Python 3.8.</li>
<li>Dropped support for Python 2 and 3.4.</li>
<li>Added type annotations to the source code. This will make Python-RSA easier to use in
your IDE, and allows better type checking.</li>
<li>Added static type checking via <a href=""http://mypy-lang.org/"">MyPy</a>.</li>
<li>Fix <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/129"">#129</a> Installing from source
gives UnicodeDecodeError.</li>
<li>Switched to using <a href=""https://poetry.eustace.io/"">Poetry</a> for package
management.</li>
<li>Added support for SHA3 hashing: SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512. This
is natively supported by Python 3.6+ and supported via a third-party
library on Python 3.5.</li>
<li>Choose blinding factor relatively prime to N. Thanks Christian Heimes for pointing this out.</li>
<li>Reject cyphertexts (when decrypting) and signatures (when verifying) that have
been modified by prepending zero bytes. This resolves CVE-2020-13757. Thanks
Adelapie for pointing this out.</li>

<h1>3.7.4 (2021-02-25)</h1>
<h2>Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>(SECURITY BUG)</strong> Started preventing open redirects in the
<code>aiohttp.web.normalize_path_middleware</code> middleware. For
more details, see
<a href=""https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wp-4m6f-gcjg"">https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wp-4m6f-gcjg</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to <code>Beast Glatisant &lt;https://github.com/g147&gt;</code>__ for
finding the first instance of this issue and <code>Jelmer Vernooĳ &lt;https://jelmer.uk/&gt;</code>__ for reporting and tracking it down
in aiohttp.
<code>[#5497](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5497) &lt;https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5497&gt;</code>_</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix interpretation difference of the pure-Python and the Cython-based
HTTP parsers construct a <code>yarl.URL</code> object for HTTP request-target.</p>
<p>Before this fix, the Python parser would turn the URI's absolute-path
for <code>//some-path</code> into <code>/</code> while the Cython code preserved it as
<code>//some-path</code>. Now, both do the latter.
<code>[#5498](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5498) &lt;https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5498&gt;</code>_</p>

<h2>Release v9.18.5</h2>
<p><strong>Version 9 has reached end-of-support and will not receive future updates or fixes.</strong></p>
<p>Please see <a href=""https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/master/VERSION_10_UPGRADE.md"">VERSION_10_UPGRADE.md</a> and perhaps <a href=""https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/master/SECURITY.md"">SECURITY.md</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>enh: Post-install script can be disabled with <code>HLJS_HIDE_UPGRADE_WARNING=yes</code></li>
<li>fix: Deprecation notice logged at library startup a <code>console.log</code> vs <code>console.warn</code>.
<ul>
<li>Notice only shown if actually highlighting code, not just requiring the library.</li>
<li>Node.js treats <code>warn</code> the same as <code>error</code> and that was problematic.</li>
<li>You (or perhaps your indirect dependency) may disable the notice with
the <code>hideUpgradeWarningAcceptNoSupportOrSecurityUpdates</code> option</li>
<li>You can also set <code>HLJS_HIDE_UPGRADE_WARNING=yes</code> in your envionment to disable the warning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre lang=""js""><code>hljs.configure({
  hideUpgradeWarningAcceptNoSupportOrSecurityUpdates: true
})

<h2>Long overdue maintenance</h2>
<p>Due to some great contributions I'm happy to announce a new release of <code>http-proxy</code> containing numerous bug fixes, feature additions and documentation improvements. Thanks to all who contributed for their patience and willingness to contribute despite perceived stagnation in activity in the project. I welcome all contributions and those who are interested in getting more involved with the project.

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add ""no-prototype-builtins"" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of ""properties that must be enumerable"".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the ""lookup""-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

I think most of this is metricsgraphics/d3 being slow with this quantity of data -- not sure how easy that is to fix. Another solution might be to only display data on an hourly interval for older data (probably taking the median value). That will still show changes over the course of each day without slowing the ui to a crawl.

We could probably do this in the getTransformedSeriesList method in the detail view. Likely if we do this sort of filtering, we should just ignore the results of the percentile filter:

### Changelog
> 
>### 1.11.5

>===========================

>*September 5, 2017*

>Django 1.11.5 fixes a security issue and several bugs in 1.11.4.

>CVE-2017-12794: Possible XSS in traceback section of technical 500 debug page
>=============================================================================

>In older versions, HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the template
>for the technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allowed
>a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn&#39;t affect most
>production sites since you shouldn&#39;t run with ``DEBUG = True`` (which makes
>this page accessible) in your production settings.

>Bugfixes
>========

>* Fixed GEOS version parsing if the version has a commit hash at the end (new
>  in GEOS 3.6.2) (:ticket:`28441`).

>* Added compatibility for ``cx_Oracle`` 6 (:ticket:`28498`).

>* Fixed select widget rendering when option values are tuples (:ticket:`28502`).

>* Django 1.11 inadvertently changed the sequence and trigger naming scheme on
>  Oracle. This causes errors on INSERTs for some tables if
>  ``&#39;use_returning_into&#39;: False`` is in the ``OPTIONS`` part of ``DATABASES``.
>  The pre-1.11 naming scheme is now restored. Unfortunately, it necessarily
>  requires an update to Oracle tables created with Django 1.11.[1-4]. Use the
>  upgrade script in :ticket:`28451` comment 8 to update sequence and trigger
>  names to use the pre-1.11 naming scheme.

>* Added POST request support to ``LogoutView``, for equivalence with the
>  function-based ``logout()`` view (:ticket:`28513`).

>* Omitted ``pages_per_range`` from ``BrinIndex.deconstruct()`` if it&#39;s ``None``
>  (:ticket:`25809`).

>* Fixed a regression where ``SelectDateWidget`` localized the years in the
>  select box (:ticket:`28530`).

>* Fixed a regression in 1.11.4 where ``runserver`` crashed with non-Unicode
>  system encodings on Python 2 + Windows (:ticket:`28487`).

>* Fixed a regression in Django 1.10 where changes to a ``ManyToManyField``
>  weren&#39;t logged in the admin change history (:ticket:`27998`) and prevented
>  ``ManyToManyField`` initial data in model forms from being affected by
>  subsequent model changes (:ticket:`28543`).

>* Fixed non-deterministic results or an ``AssertionError`` crash in some
>  queries with multiple joins (:ticket:`26522`).

>* Fixed a regression in ``contrib.auth``&#39;s ``login()`` and ``logout()`` views
>  where they ignored positional arguments (:ticket:`28550`).

### Changelog
> 
>### 1.11.4

>===========================

>*August 1, 2017*

>Django 1.11.4 fixes several bugs in 1.11.3.

>Bugfixes
>========

>* Fixed a regression in 1.11.3 on Python 2 where non-ASCII ``format`` values
>  for date/time widgets results in an empty ``value`` in the widget&#39;s HTML
>  (:ticket:`28355`).

>* Fixed ``QuerySet.union()`` and ``difference()`` when combining with
>  a queryset raising ``EmptyResultSet`` (:ticket:`28378`).

>* Fixed a regression in pickling of ``LazyObject`` on Python 2 when the wrapped
>  object doesn&#39;t have ``__reduce__()`` (:ticket:`28389`).

>* Fixed crash in ``runserver``&#39;s ``autoreload`` with Python 2 on Windows with
>  non-``str`` environment variables (:ticket:`28174`).

>* Corrected ``Field.has_changed()`` to return ``False`` for disabled form
>  fields: ``BooleanField``, ``MultipleChoiceField``, ``MultiValueField``,
>  ``FileField``, ``ModelChoiceField``, and ``ModelMultipleChoiceField``.

>* Fixed ``QuerySet.count()`` for ``union()``, ``difference()``, and
>  ``intersection()`` queries. (:ticket:`28399`).

>* Fixed ``ClearableFileInput`` rendering as a subwidget of ``MultiWidget``
>  (:ticket:`28414`). Custom ``clearable_file_input.html`` widget templates
>  will need to adapt for the fact that context values
>  ``checkbox_name``, ``checkbox_id``, ``is_initial``, ``input_text``,
>  ``initial_text``, and ``clear_checkbox_label`` are now attributes of
>  ``widget`` rather than appearing in the top-level context.

>* Fixed queryset crash when using a ``GenericRelation`` to a proxy model
>  (:ticket:`28418`).

>When making a remote procedure call from a tornado web application using the pika RabbitMQ library&#39;s Tornado connection, it is possible for the tornado web application to crash. Pika Tornado connections no longer result in an application crash.
>AttributeError generated from an unregistered application starting a MessageTransaction

>Applications which consume message transactions and do not call register_application can raise an AttributeError resulting in an application crash. This issue has now been fixed.

>  - Enable validation of Docutils XML documents against the DTD:

>* docutils/parsers/rst/:

>  - Added functionality: escaped whitespace in URI contexts.
>  - Consistent handling of all whitespace characters in inline markup
>    recognition. (May break documents that relied on some whitespace
>    characters (NBSP, ...) *not* to be recognized as whitespace.)

>* docutils/utils/smartquotes.py:

>  - Update quote definitions for et, fi, fr, ro, sv, tr, uk.
>  - Add quote definitions for hr, hsb, hu, lv, sh, sl, sr.

>* docutils/writers/_html_base:

>  - Provide default title in metadata.
>  - The MathJax CDN shut down on April 30, 2017. For security reasons, we
>    don&#39;t use a third party public installation as default but warn
>    if `math-output` is set to MathJax without specifying a URL.
>    See math-output_ for details.

>* docutils/writers/html4css1:

>  - Respect automatic table column sizing.

>* docutils/writers/latex2e/__init__.py

>  - Handle class arguments for block-level elements by wrapping them
>    in a &quot;DUclass&quot; environment. This replaces the special handling for
>    &quot;epigraph&quot; and &quot;topic&quot; elements.

>* docutils/writers/odf_odt:

>  - Language option sets ODF document&#39;s default language
>  - Image width, scale, ... set image size in generated ODF.

### Changelog
> 
>### 2.88.0.72


>This release of the Python agent adds built-in instrumentation for the pika RabbitMQ library, a message broker API which can be used to add custom instrumentation for additional message brokers, and various bug fixes.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>New Features


>Pika Instrumentation

>The RabbitMQ pika library is now automatically instrumented. The agent will report data for messages sent and received by an application. Data on messages is available in both APM and Insights.  Applications connected through a RabbitMQ exchange will now also be visible on Service Maps as part of Cross Application Tracing.
>Message Broker API

>A Message Broker API is now available for use in custom instrumentation. The Message Broker API will send data to APM and Insights (through message.routingKey and message.queueName attributes) for message broker related operations.
>Tornado 4.5 Support

>The Python Agent&#39;s out-of-the-box Tornado 4 instrumentation now supports Tornado version 4.5.
>Tornado AsyncIO Loop

>In addition to the Tornado PollIOLoop, the AsyncIO loop is now supported as part of our Tornado instrumentation.  When Tornado is configured to use the AsyncIO loop, data will now be sent to New Relic.  Note that AsyncIO is not yet generally supported.


>Bug Fixes


>SQL comments beginning with a &quot;--&quot; resulted in an improperly parsed query

>When executing SQL queries with comments that used the &quot;--&quot; comment syntax, the database operation and table was not properly parsed resulting in queries being absent from the Databases tab. Queries with &quot;--&quot; comments should now show up in the Database tab.
>AttributeError generated when using Tornado 4 HTTPRequest objects in an external web call

>When using the Tornado 4 HTTPRequest object as an argument to HTTPClient.fetch, it was possible to generate an AttributeError. The web call now completes as expected.
>Slow network connections may result in lost data

>When, due to a slow network, a 408 error is returned from New Relic data was not retransmitted. Data is now retransmitted when a 408 is received.




>### 2.86.3.70


>This release of the Python agent includes various bug fixes as described below.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>Bug Fixes


>Handle exceptions generated by Tornado 4 AsyncHTTPClient during fetch

>Exceptions generated by a call to the AsyncHTTPClient resulted in an agent instrumentation error. Exceptions generated by AsyncHTTPClient are now recorded and properly handled.
>Using gevent/eventlet on Python 3.6 resulted in a RecursionError

>Python 3.6 introduced a change to the ssl library.  This change can result in a recursion error when the New Relic agent imports ssl prior to eventlet/gevent patching the ssl library (as is the case with use of the newrelic-admin script). This recursion error has been fully mitigated.




>### 2.86.3.69


>This release of the Python agent includes various bug fixes as described below.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>Bug Fixes

>### 2.86.2.68


>This release is the same as 2.86.0.65 except it has been re-published to pypi due to an issue with 2.86.1.66.



>### 2.86.1.66



>This release has been superseded. Please use version 2.86.2.68 or higher.

This recursion error has been mitigated when using newrelic-admin to start applications.




>### 2.86.0.65


>This release of the Python agent includes improvements to our introductory support for Tornado 4 applications as well as bug fixes.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>New Feature


>Tornado 4 Outbound Cross Application Tracing

>Tornado 4 Cross Application Tracing is now supported for outbound web transactions. In addition to Service Maps, Tornado 4 transaction traces will now contain links to the application it called. With this update, Cross Application Tracing is now fully supported for Tornado 4 applications.


>Bug Fixes


>Django 1.10+ browser monitoring with new-style gzip middleware

>Browser monitoring was not automatically inserted when using new style Django 1.10+ gzip middleware. Browser monitoring code is now inserted as expected.
>Using motor versions 1.X generated instrumentation errors

>Motor 1.0 removed the MotorReplicaSetClient class which resulted in the New Relic Python Agent generating an instrumentation error when attempting to access that class. The instrumentation has been fixed.




>### 2.84.0.64


>This release of the Python agent includes bug fixes and improvements to the precision of the duration data recorded for transaction traces.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>Improved Feature


>Transaction trace precision

>This release improves the precision of transaction traces. Duration of functions in a transaction trace are now recorded at sub-millisecond precision.


>Bug Fixes


>Custom classmethod traces may incorrectly return the parent class

>Wrapping classmethods in classes that are subclassed could cause the subclassed classmethod to be improperly bound to the parent class.  This would result in the classmethod returning an instance of the parent class when the method was called on a child class.
>Handle incomplete Tornado coroutine traces

>Tracing a Tornado coroutine that never completed and was later garbage collected, could result in an application hang.  This has been fixed.




>### 2.82.1.63


>This release of the Python agent includes a bug fix for our introductory support for Tornado 4 applications.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>Bug Fixes


>Ending Tornado 4 transactions inside of a traced function results in an internal agent error

>Ending a Tornado 4 web transaction within a traced function previously resulted in the generation of an agent traceback. The agent now completes tracing the function before ending the transaction, resulting in the correct reporting of these transactions to New Relic.




>### 2.82.0.62


>This release of the Python agent improves our introductory support for Tornado 4 applications by adding Cross Application Tracing for web transactions that are sent to a Tornado 4 application.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>New Feature


>Tornado 4 applications will now appear in Service Maps

>Tornado 4 Cross Application Tracing is now supported for inbound web transactions. In addition to Service Maps, the calling application&#39;s APM will now have links to the Tornado 4 application it called in the External Services tab and in Transaction Traces.


>Bug Fixes


>Record exceptions outside of view handlers in Django 1.10

>Unhandled exceptions that occurred outside of a view handler in Django 1.10 were not reported. In addition to middleware exceptions, these unhandled exceptions can be generated when a view handler returns a TemplateResponse and rendering that template would result in an exception.
>Consistent WSGI/Application and WSGI/Response segments

>Prior to this release, the agent would group segments under WSGI/Application and WSGI/Response differently, depending on whether or not browser monitoring was enabled. This has now been made consistent.
>Improved New Relic WSGI middleware behavior

>The New Relic agent is now resilient when called by non-conforming middleware.  Transactions will continue to be reported normally when the New Relic agent is called by WSGI middleware that does not call the close() method as described in the PEP 333 specification.




>### 2.80.1.61


>This release of the Python agent is a hotfix release to address a problem with the Tornado 4 instrumentation for curl_httpclient introduced in our last release (v2.80.0.60). Under the circumstances described below, calling CurlAsyncHTTPClient.fetch_impl() could result in an agent error.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from our download site.

>Bug Fix


>Fix CurlAsyncHTTPClient.fetch_impl() instrumentation

>If fetch_impl() was called by passing the request argument positionally, but passing callback as a keyword argument, then the agent would throw an error. In practice, this only affected customers who implemented a custom version of fetch_impl(), but for those affected customers, this is now fixed.




>### 2.80.0.60


>This release of the Python agent enhances our introductory support for Tornado 4, most notably by adding support for tornado.curl_httpclient.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>New Features


>Tornado 4 curl_httpclient support

>Previously, the agent&#39;s Tornado 4 instrumentation only supported the default tornado.simple_httpclient. With this release, support has been added for tornado.curl_httpclient as well.
>Tornado 4 ZeroMQ IOLoop support

>Using ZMQIOLoop in place of the default Tornado IOLoop is now supported for Tornado 4 applications.


>Improved Feature


>Improved transaction names for Django REST Framework

>When using the Python agent with Django REST Framework and Python 3, function-based views wrapped with the rest_framework.decorators.api_view decorator would result in transactions with names based on the decorator (WrappedAPIView.handler) rather than names based on the original view function. (This did not affect applications running with Python 2.)

>With this release, the transaction names for these wrapped views are now based on the name of the original view function in both Python 2 and Python 3.


>Bug Fix


>End transactions correctly with Tornado 4 asynchronous decorator

>When the agent records a transaction for a Tornado 4 RequestHandler method that is decorated with the tornado.web.asynchronous decorator, the transaction should remain open until RequestHandler.finish() is called. Prior to this release, there were some circumstances where the agent closed the transaction prematurely, resulting in transaction durations that were too short. This has now been fixed.

### Changelog
> 
>### 4.4.1

>----------------------------

>- No code changes: just corrected packaging for Python 2.7 Linux wheels.


>.. _changes_44:



>### 4.4

>--------------------------

>- Reports could produce the wrong file names for packages, reporting ``pkg.py``
>  instead of the correct ``pkg/__init__.py``.  This is now fixed.  Thanks, Dirk
>  Thomas.

>- XML reports could produce ``&lt;source&gt;`` and ``&lt;class&gt;`` lines that together
>  didn&#39;t specify a valid source file path.  This is now fixed. (`issue 526`_)

>- Namespace packages are no longer warned as having no code. (`issue 572`_)

>- Code that uses ``sys.settrace(sys.gettrace())`` in a file that wasn&#39;t being
>  coverage-measured would prevent correct coverage measurement in following
>  code. An example of this was running doctests programmatically. This is now
>  fixed. (`issue 575`_)

>- Errors printed by the ``coverage`` command now go to stderr instead of
>  stdout.

>- Running ``coverage xml`` in a directory named with non-ASCII characters would
>  fail under Python 2. This is now fixed. (`issue 573`_)

>.. _issue 526: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/526/generated-xml-invalid-paths-for-cobertura

>.. _issue 575: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/575/running-doctest-prevents-complete-coverage




>### 4.4b1

>----------------------------

>- Some warnings can now be individually disabled.  Warnings that can be
>  disabled have a short name appended.  The ``[run] disable_warnings`` setting
>  takes a list of these warning names to disable. Closes both `issue 96`_ and
>  `issue 355`_.

>- The XML report now includes attributes from version 4 of the Cobertura XML
>  format, fixing `issue 570`_.

>- In previous versions, calling a method that used collected data would prevent
>  further collection.  For example, `save()`, `report()`, `html_report()`, and
>  others would all stop collection.  An explicit `start()` was needed to get it
>  going again.  This is no longer true.  Now you can use the collected data and
>  also continue measurement. Both `issue 79`_ and `issue 448`_ described this
>  problem, and have been fixed.

>- Plugins can now find unexecuted files if they choose, by implementing the
>  `find_executable_files` method.  Thanks, Emil Madsen.

>- Minimal IronPython support. You should be able to run IronPython programs
>  under ``coverage run``, though you will still have to do the reporting phase
>  with CPython.

>- Coverage.py has long had a special hack to support CPython&#39;s need to measure
>  the coverage of the standard library tests. This code was not installed by
>  kitted versions of coverage.py.  Now it is.

>        :tags: bug, orm
>        :tickets: 4011
>        :versions: 1.2.0b1

>        Fixed issue with subquery eagerloading which continues on from
>        the series of issues fixed in :ticket:`2699`, :ticket:`3106`,
>        :ticket:`3893` involving that the &quot;subquery&quot; contains the correct
>        FROM clause when beginning from a joined inheritance subclass
>        and then subquery eager loading onto a relationship from
>        the base class, while the query also includes criteria against
>        the subclass. The fix in the previous tickets did not accommodate
>        for additional subqueryload operations loading more deeply from
>        the first level, so the fix has been further generalized.

>        version string &quot;10devel&quot; released in 1.1.8, an additional regexp
>        bump to handle version strings of the form &quot;10beta1&quot;.   While
>        Postgresql now offers better ways to get this information, we
>        are sticking w/ the regexp at least through 1.1.x for the least

>        within CREATE TABLE.

>    .. change:: 4007
>        :tags: bug, mysql
>        :tickets: 4007
>        :versions: 1.2.0b1

>        MySQL 5.7 has introduced permission limiting for the &quot;SHOW VARIABLES&quot;

### Changelog
> 
>### 2.86.3.70


>This release of the Python agent includes various bug fixes as described below.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>Bug Fixes


>Handle exceptions generated by Tornado 4 AsyncHTTPClient during fetch

>Exceptions generated by a call to the Tornado 4 AsyncHTTPClient resulted in an agent instrumentation error. Exceptions generated by AsyncHTTPClient are now recorded and properly handled.
>Using gevent/eventlet on Python 3.6 resulted in a RecursionError

>Python 3.6 introduced a change to the ssl library.  This change can result in a recursion error when the New Relic agent imports ssl prior to eventlet/gevent patching the ssl library (as is the case with use of the newrelic-admin script). This recursion error has been fully mitigated.




>### 2.86.3.69

>### 2.86.0.65


>This release of the Python agent includes improvements to our introductory support for Tornado 4 applications as well as bug fixes.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>New Feature


>Tornado 4 Outbound Cross Application Tracing

>Tornado 4 Cross Application Tracing is now supported for outbound web transactions. In addition to Service Maps, Tornado 4 transaction traces will now contain links to the application it called. With this update, Cross Application Tracing is now fully supported for Tornado 4 applications.


>Bug Fixes


>Django 1.10+ browser monitoring with new-style gzip middleware

>Browser monitoring was not automatically inserted when using new style Django 1.10+ gzip middleware. Browser monitoring code is now inserted as expected.
>Using motor versions 1.X generated instrumentation errors

>Motor 1.0 removed the MotorReplicaSetClient class which resulted in the New Relic Python Agent generating an instrumentation error when attempting to access that class. The instrumentation has been fixed.




>### 2.84.0.64


>This release of the Python agent includes bug fixes and improvements to the precision of the duration data recorded for transaction traces.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>Improved Feature


>Transaction trace precision

>This release improves the precision of transaction traces. Duration of functions in a transaction trace are now recorded at sub-millisecond precision.


>Bug Fixes


>Custom classmethod traces may incorrectly return the parent class

>Wrapping classmethods in classes that are subclassed could cause the subclassed classmethod to be improperly bound to the parent class.  This would result in the classmethod returning an instance of the parent class when the method was called on a child class.
>Handle incomplete Tornado coroutine traces

>Tracing a Tornado coroutine that never completed and was later garbage collected, could result in an application hang.  This has been fixed.




>### 2.82.1.63


>This release of the Python agent includes a bug fix for our introductory support for Tornado 4 applications.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>Bug Fixes


>Ending Tornado 4 transactions inside of a traced function results in an internal agent error

>Ending a Tornado 4 web transaction within a traced function previously resulted in the generation of an agent traceback. The agent now completes tracing the function before ending the transaction, resulting in the correct reporting of these transactions to New Relic.




>### 2.82.0.62


>This release of the Python agent improves our introductory support for Tornado 4 applications by adding Cross Application Tracing for web transactions that are sent to a Tornado 4 application.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>New Feature


>Tornado 4 applications will now appear in Service Maps

>Tornado 4 Cross Application Tracing is now supported for inbound web transactions. In addition to Service Maps, the calling application&#39;s APM will now have links to the Tornado 4 application it called in the External Services tab and in Transaction Traces.


>Bug Fixes


>Record exceptions outside of view handlers in Django 1.10

>Unhandled exceptions that occurred outside of a view handler in Django 1.10 were not reported. In addition to middleware exceptions, these unhandled exceptions can be generated when a view handler returns a TemplateResponse and rendering that template would result in an exception.
>Consistent WSGI/Application and WSGI/Response segments

>Prior to this release, the agent would group segments under WSGI/Application and WSGI/Response differently, depending on whether or not browser monitoring was enabled. This has now been made consistent.
>Improved New Relic WSGI middleware behavior

>The New Relic agent is now resilient when called by non-conforming middleware.  Transactions will continue to be reported normally when the New Relic agent is called by WSGI middleware that does not call the close() method as described in the PEP 333 specification.




>### 2.80.1.61


>This release of the Python agent is a hotfix release to address a problem with the Tornado 4 instrumentation for curl_httpclient introduced in our last release (v2.80.0.60). Under the circumstances described below, calling CurlAsyncHTTPClient.fetch_impl() could result in an agent error.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from our download site.

>Bug Fix


>Fix CurlAsyncHTTPClient.fetch_impl() instrumentation

>If fetch_impl() was called by passing the request argument positionally, but passing callback as a keyword argument, then the agent would throw an error. In practice, this only affected customers who implemented a custom version of fetch_impl(), but for those affected customers, this is now fixed.




>### 2.80.0.60


>This release of the Python agent enhances our introductory support for Tornado 4, most notably by adding support for tornado.curl_httpclient.

>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site.

>New Features


>Tornado 4 curl_httpclient support

>Previously, the agent&#39;s Tornado 4 instrumentation only supported the default tornado.simple_httpclient. With this release, support has been added for tornado.curl_httpclient as well.
>Tornado 4 ZeroMQ IOLoop support

>Using ZMQIOLoop in place of the default Tornado IOLoop is now supported for Tornado 4 applications.


>Improved Feature


>Improved transaction names for Django REST Framework

>When using the Python agent with Django REST Framework and Python 3, function-based views wrapped with the rest_framework.decorators.api_view decorator would result in transactions with names based on the decorator (WrappedAPIView.handler) rather than names based on the original view function. (This did not affect applications running with Python 2.)

>With this release, the transaction names for these wrapped views are now based on the name of the original view function in both Python 2 and Python 3.


>Bug Fix


>End transactions correctly with Tornado 4 asynchronous decorator

>When the agent records a transaction for a Tornado 4 RequestHandler method that is decorated with the tornado.web.asynchronous decorator, the transaction should remain open until RequestHandler.finish() is called. Prior to this release, there were some circumstances where the agent closed the transaction prematurely, resulting in transaction durations that were too short. This has now been fixed.

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.3.0

>------

> * Support the new `immutable &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-ControlRevalidation_and_reloading&gt;`_
>   Cache-Control header. This gives better caching behaviour for immutable resources than
>   simply setting a large max age.



>### 3.2.3

>------

> * Gracefully handle invalid byte sequences in URLs.
> * Gracefully handle filenames which are too long for the filesystem.
> * Send correct Content-Type for Adobe&#39;s ``crossdomain.xml`` files.



>### 3.2.2

>------

> * Convert any config values supplied as byte strings to text to avoid
>   runtime encoding errors when encountering non-ASCII filenames.



>### 3.2.1

>------

> * Handle non-ASCII URLs correctly when using the ``wsgi.py`` integration.
> * Fix exception triggered when a static files &quot;finder&quot; returned a directory
>   rather than a file.



>### 3.2

>----

> * Add support for the new-style middleware classes introduced in Django 1.10.
>   The same WhiteNoiseMiddleware class can now be used in either the old
>   ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` list or the new ``MIDDLEWARE`` list.
> * Fixed a bug where incorrect Content-Type headers were being sent on 304 Not
>   Modified responses (thanks `oppianmatt &lt;https://github.com/oppianmatt&gt;`_).
> * Return Vary and Cache-Control headers on 304 responses, as specified by the
>   `RFC &lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232section-4.1&gt;`_.



>### 3.1

>----

> * Add new :any:`WHITENOISE_STATIC_PREFIX` setting to give flexibility in
>   supporting non-standard deployment configurations e.g. serving the
>   application somewhere other than the domain root.
> * Fix bytes/unicode bug when running with Django 1.10 on Python 2.7



>### 3.0

>----

>.. note:: The latest version of WhiteNoise contains some small **breaking changes**.
>   Most users will be able to upgrade without any problems, but some
>   less-used APIs have been modified:

>    * The setting ``WHITENOISE_GZIP_EXCLUDE_EXTENSIONS`` has been renamed to
>      ``WHITENOISE_SKIP_COMPRESS_EXTENSIONS``.
>    * The CLI :ref:`compression utility &lt;cli-utility&gt;` has moved from ``python -m whitenoise.gzip``
>      to ``python -m whitenoise.compress``.
>    * The now redundant ``gzipstatic`` management command has been removed.
>    * WhiteNoise no longer uses the system mimetypes files, so if you are serving
>      particularly obscure filetypes you may need to add their mimetypes explicitly
>      using the new :any:`mimetypes &lt;WHITENOISE_MIMETYPES&gt;` setting.
>    * Older versions of Django (1.4-1.7) and Python (2.6) are no longer supported.
>      If you need support for these platforms you can continue to use `WhiteNoise
>      2.x`_.
>    * The ``whitenoise.django.GzipManifestStaticFilesStorage`` storage backend
>      has been moved to
>      ``whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage``.  The old
>      import path **will continue to work** for now, but users are encouraged
>      to update their code to use the new path.

>.. _WhiteNoise 2.x: http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/legacy-2.x/


>Simpler, cleaner Django middleware integration
>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

>WhiteNoise can now integrate with Django by adding a single line to
>``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``  without any need to edit ``wsgi.py``. This also means
>that WhiteNoise plays nicely with other middleware classes such as
>*SecurityMiddleware*, and that it is fully compatible with the new `Channels`_
>system. See the :ref:`updated documentation &lt;django-middleware&gt;` for details.

>.. _Channels: https://channels.readthedocs.io/


>Brotli compression support
>++++++++++++++++++++++++++

>`Brotli`_ is the modern, more efficient alternative to gzip for HTTP
>compression. To benefit from smaller files and faster page loads, just install
>the `brotlipy`_ library, update your ``requirements.txt`` and WhiteNoise
>will take care of the rest. See the :ref:`documentation &lt;brotli-compression&gt;`
>for details.

>.. _brotli: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli
>.. _brotlipy: https://brotlipy.readthedocs.io/


>Simpler customisation
>+++++++++++++++++++++

>It&#39;s now possible to add custom headers to WhiteNoise without needing to create
>a subclass, using the new :any:`add_headers_function
>&lt;WHITENOISE_ADD_HEADERS_FUNCTION&gt;` setting.


>Use WhiteNoise in development with Django
>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

>There&#39;s now an option to force Django to use WhiteNoise in development, rather
>than its own static file handling. This results in more consistent behaviour
>between development and production environments and fewer opportunities for
>bugs and surprises. See the :ref:`documentation &lt;runserver-nostatic&gt;` for
>details.



>Improved mimetype handling
>++++++++++++++++++++++++++

>WhiteNoise now ships with its own mimetype definitions (based on those shipped
>with nginx) instead of relying on the system ones, which can vary between
>environments. There is a new :any:`mimetypes &lt;WHITENOISE_MIMETYPES&gt;`
>configuration option which makes it easy to add additional type definitions if
>needed.


>Thanks
>++++++

>A big thank-you to `Ed Morley &lt;https://github.com/edmorley&gt;`_ and `Tim Graham
>&lt;https://github.com/timgraham&gt;`_ for their contributions to this release.

>  connection pools such as pgbouncer; use :sql:`BEGIN` options instead
>  (:ticket:`503`).
>- `~connection.isolation_level` is now writable and entirely separated from
>  `~connection.autocommit`; added `~connection.readonly`,
>  `~connection.deferrable` writable attributes.

>Bug fixes:

>- Fixed error caused by missing decoding `~psycopg2.extras.LoggingConnection`

### Changelog
> 
>### 1.11.3

>===========================

>*July 1, 2017*

>Django 1.11.3 fixes several bugs in 1.11.2.

>Bugfixes
>========

>* Removed an incorrect deprecation warning about a missing ``renderer``
>  argument if a ``Widget.render()`` method accepts ``**kwargs``
>  (:ticket:`28265`).

>* Fixed a regression causing ``Model.__init__()`` to crash if a field has an
>  instance only descriptor (:ticket:`28269`).

>* Fixed an incorrect ``DisallowedModelAdminLookup`` exception when using
>  a nested reverse relation in ``list_filter`` (:ticket:`28262`).

>* Fixed admin&#39;s ``FieldListFilter.get_queryset()`` crash on invalid input
>  (:ticket:`28202`).

>* Fixed invalid HTML for a required ``AdminFileWidget`` (:ticket:`28278`).

>* Fixed model initialization to set the name of class-based model indexes
>  for models that only inherit ``models.Model`` (:ticket:`28282`).

>* Fixed crash in admin&#39;s inlines when a model has an inherited non-editable
>  primary key (:ticket:`27967`).

>* Fixed ``QuerySet.union()``, ``intersection()``, and ``difference()`` when
>  combining with an ``EmptyQuerySet`` (:ticket:`28293`).

>* Prevented ``Paginator``’s unordered object list warning from evaluating a
>  ``QuerySet`` (:ticket:`28284`).

>* Fixed the value of ``redirect_field_name`` in ``LoginView``’s template
>  context. It&#39;s now an empty string (as it is for the original function-based
>  ``login()`` view) if the corresponding parameter isn&#39;t sent in a request (in
>  particular, when the login page is accessed directly) (:ticket:`28229`).

>* Prevented attribute values in the ``django/forms/widgets/attrs.html``
>  template from being localized so that numeric attributes (e.g. ``max`` and
>  ``min``) of ``NumberInput`` work correctly (:ticket:`28303`).

>* Removed casting of the option value to a string in the template context of
>  the ``CheckboxSelectMultiple``, ``NullBooleanSelect``, ``RadioSelect``,
>  ``SelectMultiple``, and ``Select`` widgets (:ticket:`28176`). In Django
>  1.11.1, casting was added in Python to avoid localization of numeric values
>  in Django templates, but this made some use cases more difficult. Casting is
>  now done in the template using the ``|stringformat:&#39;s&#39;`` filter.

>* Prevented a primary key alteration from adding a foreign key constraint if
>  ``db_constraint=False`` (:ticket:`28298`).

>* Fixed ``UnboundLocalError`` crash in ``RenameField`` with nonexistent field
>  (:ticket:`28350`).

>* Fixed a regression preventing a model field&#39;s ``limit_choices_to`` from being
>  evaluated when a ``ModelForm`` is instantiated (:ticket:`28345`).


>===========================


>### 1.11.2

>===========================

>*June 1, 2017*

>Django 1.11.2 adds a minor feature and fixes several bugs in 1.11.1. Also, the
>latest string translations from Transifex are incorporated.

>Minor feature
>=============

>The new ``LiveServerTestCase.port`` attribute reallows the use case of binding
>to a specific port following the :ref:`bind to port zero
>&lt;liveservertestcase-port-zero-change&gt;` change in Django 1.11.

>Bugfixes
>========

>* Added detection for GDAL 2.1 and 2.0, and removed detection for unsupported
>  versions 1.7 and 1.8 (:ticket:`28181`).

>* Changed ``contrib.gis`` to raise ``ImproperlyConfigured`` rather than
>  ``GDALException`` if ``gdal`` isn&#39;t installed, to allow third-party apps to
>  catch that exception (:ticket:`28178`).

>* Fixed ``django.utils.http.is_safe_url()`` crash on invalid IPv6 URLs
>  (:ticket:`28142`).

>* Fixed regression causing pickling of model fields to crash (:ticket:`28188`).

>* Fixed ``django.contrib.auth.authenticate()`` when multiple authentication
>  backends don&#39;t accept a positional ``request`` argument (:ticket:`28207`).

>* Fixed introspection of index field ordering on PostgreSQL (:ticket:`28197`).

>* Fixed a regression where ``Model._state.adding`` wasn&#39;t set correctly on
>  multi-table inheritance parent models after saving a child model
>  (:ticket:`28210`).

>* Allowed ``DjangoJSONEncoder`` to serialize
>  ``django.utils.deprecation.CallableBool`` (:ticket:`28230`).

>* Relaxed the validation added in Django 1.11 of the fields in the ``defaults``
>  argument of ``QuerySet.get_or_create()`` and ``update_or_create()`` to
>  reallow settable model properties (:ticket:`28222`).

>* Fixed ``MultipleObjectMixin.paginate_queryset()`` crash on Python 2 if the
>  ``InvalidPage`` message contains non-ASCII (:ticket:`28204`).

>* Prevented ``Subquery`` from adding an unnecessary ``CAST`` which resulted in
>  invalid SQL (:ticket:`28199`).

>* Corrected detection of GDAL 2.1 on Windows (:ticket:`28181`).

>* Made date-based generic views return a 404 rather than crash when given an
>  out of range date (:ticket:`28209`).

>* Fixed a regression where ``file_move_safe()`` crashed when moving files to a
>  CIFS mount (:ticket:`28170`).

>* Moved the ``ImageField`` file extension validation added in Django 1.11 from
>  the model field to the form field to reallow the use case of storing images
>  without an extension (:ticket:`28242`).


>===========================


>### 1.11.1

>===========================

>*May 6, 2017*

>Django 1.11.1 adds a minor feature and fixes several bugs in 1.11.

>Allowed disabling server-side cursors on PostgreSQL
>===================================================

>The change in Django 1.11 to make :meth:`.QuerySet.iterator()` use server-side
>cursors on PostgreSQL prevents running Django with `pgBouncer` in transaction
>pooling mode. To reallow that, use the :setting:`DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS
>&lt;DATABASE-DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS&gt;` setting in :setting:`DATABASES`.

>See :ref:`transaction-pooling-server-side-cursors` for more discussion.

>Bugfixes
>========

>* Made migrations respect ``Index``’s ``name`` argument. If you created a
>  named index with Django 1.11, ``makemigrations`` will create a migration to
>  recreate the index with the correct name (:ticket:`28051`).

>* Fixed a crash when using a ``__icontains`` lookup on a ``ArrayField``
>  (:ticket:`28038`).

>* Fixed a crash when using a two-tuple in ``EmailMessage``’s ``attachments``
>  argument (:ticket:`28042`).

>* Fixed ``QuerySet.filter()`` crash when it references the name of a
>  ``OneToOneField`` primary key (:ticket:`28047`).

>* Fixed empty POST data table appearing instead of &quot;No POST data&quot; in HTML debug
>  page (:ticket:`28079`).

>* Restored ``BoundField``\s without any ``choices`` evaluating to ``True``
>  (:ticket:`28058`).

>* Prevented ``SessionBase.cycle_key()`` from losing session data if
>  ``_session_cache`` isn&#39;t populated (:ticket:`28066`).

>* Fixed layout of ``ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget`` (used in the admin&#39;s user
>  change page) (:ticket:`28097`).

>* Allowed prefetch calls on managers with custom ``ModelIterable`` subclasses
>  (:ticket:`28096`).

>* Fixed change password link in the ``contrib.auth`` admin for ``el``,
>  ``es_MX``, and ``pt`` translations (:ticket:`28100`).

>* Restored the output of the ``class`` attribute in the ``&lt;ul&gt;`` of widgets
>  that use the ``multiple_input.html`` template. This fixes
>  ``ModelAdmin.radio_fields`` with ``admin.HORIZONTAL`` (:ticket:`28059`).

>* Fixed crash in ``BaseGeometryWidget.subwidgets()`` (:ticket:`28039`).

>* Fixed exception reraising in ORM query execution when ``cursor.execute()``
>  fails and the subsequent ``cursor.close()`` also fails (:ticket:`28091`).

>* Fixed a regression where ``CheckboxSelectMultiple``, ``NullBooleanSelect``,
>  ``RadioSelect``, ``SelectMultiple``, and ``Select`` localized option values
>  (:ticket:`28075`).

>* Corrected the stack level of unordered queryset pagination warnings
>  (:ticket:`28109`).

>* Fixed a regression causing incorrect queries for ``__in`` subquery lookups
>  when models use ``ForeignKey.to_field`` (:ticket:`28101`).

>* Fixed crash when overriding the template of
>  ``django.views.static.directory_index()`` (:ticket:`28122`).

>* Fixed a regression in formset ``min_num`` validation with unchanged forms
>  that have initial data (:ticket:`28130`).

>* Prepared for ``cx_Oracle`` 6.0 support (:ticket:`28138`).

>* Updated the ``contrib.postgres`` ``SplitArrayWidget`` to use template-based
>  widget rendering (:ticket:`28040`).

>* Fixed crash in ``BaseGeometryWidget.get_context()`` when overriding existing
>  ``attrs`` (:ticket:`28105`).

>* Prevented ``AddIndex`` and ``RemoveIndex`` from mutating model state
>  (:ticket:`28043`).

>* Prevented migrations from dropping database indexes from ``Meta.indexes``
>  when changing ``Field.db_index`` to ``False`` (:ticket:`28052`).

>* Fixed a regression in choice ordering in form fields with grouped and
>  non-grouped options (:ticket:`28157`).

>* Fixed crash in  ``BaseInlineFormSet._construct_form()`` when using
>  ``save_as_new`` (:ticket:`28159`).

>* Fixed a regression where ``Model._state.db`` wasn&#39;t set correctly on
>  multi-table inheritance parent models after saving a child model

>* Prevented hiding GDAL errors if it&#39;s not installed when using ``contrib.gis``
>  (:ticket:`28160`). (It&#39;s a required dependency as of Django 1.11.)

>* Fixed a regression causing ``__in`` lookups on a foreign key to fail when
>  using the foreign key&#39;s parent model as the lookup value (:ticket:`28175`).

>### 1.11

>=========================

>*April 4, 2017*

>Welcome to Django 1.11!

>These release notes cover the :ref:`new features &lt;whats-new-1.11&gt;`, as well as
>some :ref:`backwards incompatible changes &lt;backwards-incompatible-1.11&gt;` you&#39;ll
>want to be aware of when upgrading from Django 1.10 or older versions. We&#39;ve
>:ref:`begun the deprecation process for some features
>&lt;deprecated-features-1.11&gt;`.

>See the :doc:`/howto/upgrade-version` guide if you&#39;re updating an existing
>project.

>Django 1.11 is designated as a :term:`long-term support release`. It will
>receive security updates for at least three years after its release. Support
>for the previous LTS, Django 1.8, will end in April 2018.

>Python compatibility
>====================

>Django 1.11 requires Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6. Django 1.11 is the first
>release to support Python 3.6. We **highly recommend** and only officially
>support the latest release of each series.

>The Django 1.11.x series is the last to support Python 2. The next major
>release, Django 2.0, will only support Python 3.5+.

>Deprecating warnings are no longer loud by default
>==================================================

>Unlike older versions of Django, Django&#39;s own deprecation warnings are no
>longer displayed by default. This is consistent with Python&#39;s default behavior.

>This change allows third-party apps to support both Django 1.11 LTS and Django
>1.8 LTS without having to add code to avoid deprecation warnings.

>Following the release of Django 2.0, we suggest that third-party app authors
>drop support for all versions of Django prior to 1.11. At that time, you should
>be able run your package&#39;s tests using ``python -Wd`` so that deprecation
>warnings do appear. After making the deprecation warning fixes, your app should
>be compatible with Django 2.0.

>.. _whats-new-1.11:

>What&#39;s new in Django 1.11
>=========================

>Class-based model indexes
>-------------------------

>The new :mod:`django.db.models.indexes` module contains classes which ease
>creating database indexes. Indexes are added to models using the
>:attr:`Meta.indexes &lt;django.db.models.Options.indexes&gt;` option.

>The :class:`~django.db.models.Index` class creates a b-tree index, as if you
>used :attr:`~django.db.models.Field.db_index` on the model field or
>:attr:`~django.db.models.Options.index_together` on the model ``Meta`` class.
>It can be subclassed to support different index types, such as
>:class:`~django.contrib.postgres.indexes.GinIndex`. It also allows defining the
>order (ASC/DESC) for the columns of the index.

>Template-based widget rendering
>-------------------------------

>To ease customizing widgets, form widget rendering is now done using the
>template system rather than in Python. See :doc:`/ref/forms/renderers`.

>You may need to adjust any custom widgets that you&#39;ve written for a few
>:ref:`backwards incompatible changes &lt;template-widget-incompatibilities-1-11&gt;`.

>``Subquery`` expressions
>------------------------

>The new :class:`~django.db.models.Subquery` and
>:class:`~django.db.models.Exists` database expressions allow creating
>explicit subqueries. Subqueries may refer to fields from the outer queryset
>using the :class:`~django.db.models.OuterRef` class.

>Minor features
>--------------

>:mod:`django.contrib.admin`
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>* :attr:`.ModelAdmin.date_hierarchy` can now reference fields across relations.

>* The new :meth:`ModelAdmin.get_exclude()
>  &lt;django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_exclude&gt;` hook allows specifying the
>  exclude fields based on the request or model instance.

>* The ``popup_response.html`` template can now be overridden per app, per
>  model, or by setting the :attr:`.ModelAdmin.popup_response_template`
>  attribute.

>:mod:`django.contrib.auth`
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>* The default iteration count for the PBKDF2 password hasher is increased by
>  20%.

>* The :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView` and
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.LogoutView` class-based views supersede the
>  deprecated ``login()`` and ``logout()`` function-based views.

>* The :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordChangeView`,
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordChangeDoneView`,
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetView`,
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetDoneView`,
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetConfirmView`, and
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetCompleteView` class-based
>  views supersede the deprecated ``password_change()``,
>  ``password_change_done()``, ``password_reset()``, ``password_reset_done()``,
>  ``password_reset_confirm()``, and ``password_reset_complete()`` function-based
>  views.

>* The new ``post_reset_login`` attribute for
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetConfirmView` allows
>  automatically logging in a user after a successful password reset.
>  If you have multiple ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` configured, use the
>  ``post_reset_login_backend`` attribute to choose which one to use.

>* To avoid the possibility of leaking a password reset token via the HTTP
>  Referer header (for example, if the reset page includes a reference to CSS or
>  JavaScript hosted on another domain), the
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetConfirmView` (but not the
>  deprecated ``password_reset_confirm()`` function-based view) stores the token
>  in a session and redirects to itself to present the password change form to
>  the user without the token in the URL.

>* :func:`~django.contrib.auth.update_session_auth_hash` now rotates the session
>  key to allow a password change to invalidate stolen session cookies.

>* The new ``success_url_allowed_hosts`` attribute for
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView` and
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.LogoutView` allows specifying a set of
>  hosts that are safe for redirecting after login and logout.

>* Added password validators ``help_text`` to
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm`.

>* The ``HttpRequest`` is now passed to :func:`~django.contrib.auth.authenticate`
>  which in turn passes it to the authentication backend if it accepts a
>  ``request`` argument.

>* The :func:`~django.contrib.auth.signals.user_login_failed` signal now
>  receives a ``request`` argument.

>* :class:`~django.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordResetForm` supports custom user
>  models that use an email field named something other than ``&#39;email&#39;``.
>  Set :attr:`CustomUser.EMAIL_FIELD
>  &lt;django.contrib.auth.models.CustomUser.EMAIL_FIELD&gt;` to the name of the field.

>* :func:`~django.contrib.auth.get_user_model` can now be called at import time,
>  even in modules that define models.

>:mod:`django.contrib.contenttypes`
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>* When stale content types are detected in the
>  :djadmin:`remove_stale_contenttypes` command, there&#39;s now a list of related
>  objects such as ``auth.Permission``\s that will also be deleted. Previously,
>  only the content types were listed (and this prompt was after ``migrate``
>  rather than in a separate command).

>:mod:`django.contrib.gis`
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>* The new :meth:`.GEOSGeometry.from_gml` and :meth:`.OGRGeometry.from_gml`
>  methods allow creating geometries from GML.

>* Added support for the :lookup:`dwithin` lookup on SpatiaLite.

>* The :class:`~django.contrib.gis.db.models.functions.Area` function,
>  :class:`~django.contrib.gis.db.models.functions.Distance` function, and
>  distance lookups now work with geodetic coordinates on SpatiaLite.

>* The OpenLayers-based form widgets now use ``OpenLayers.js`` from
>  ``https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com`` which is more suitable for production use
>  than the the old ``http://openlayers.org`` source. They are also updated to
>  use OpenLayers 3.

>* PostGIS migrations can now change field dimensions.

>* Added the ability to pass the `size`, `shape`, and `offset` parameter when
>  creating :class:`~django.contrib.gis.gdal.GDALRaster` objects.

>* Added SpatiaLite support for the
>  :class:`~django.contrib.gis.db.models.functions.IsValid` function,
>  :class:`~django.contrib.gis.db.models.functions.MakeValid` function, and
>  :lookup:`isvalid` lookup.

>* Added Oracle support for the
>  :class:`~django.contrib.gis.db.models.functions.AsGML` function,
>  :class:`~django.contrib.gis.db.models.functions.BoundingCircle` function,
>  :class:`~django.contrib.gis.db.models.functions.IsValid` function, and
>  :lookup:`isvalid` lookup.

>:mod:`django.contrib.postgres`
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>* The new ``distinct`` argument for
>  :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg` determines if
>  concatenated values will be distinct.

>* The new :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.indexes.GinIndex` and
>  :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.indexes.BrinIndex` classes allow
>  creating ``GIN`` and ``BRIN`` indexes in the database.

>* :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField` accepts a new ``encoder``
>  parameter to specify a custom class to encode data types not supported by the
>  standard encoder.

>* The new :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.fields.CIText` mixin and
>  :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.operations.CITextExtension` migration
>  operation allow using PostgreSQL&#39;s ``citext`` extension for case-insensitive
>  lookups. Three fields are provided: :class:`.CICharField`,
>  :class:`.CIEmailField`, and :class:`.CITextField`.

>* The new :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.aggregates.JSONBAgg` allows
>  aggregating values as a JSON array.

>* The :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.fields.HStoreField` (model field) and
>  :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.forms.HStoreField` (form field) allow
>  storing null values.

>Cache
>~~~~~

>* Memcached backends now pass the contents of :setting:`OPTIONS &lt;CACHES-OPTIONS&gt;`
>  as keyword arguments to the client constructors, allowing for more advanced
>  control of client behavior. See the :ref:`cache arguments &lt;cache_arguments&gt;`
>  documentation for examples.

>* Memcached backends now allow defining multiple servers as a comma-delimited
>  string in :setting:`LOCATION &lt;CACHES-LOCATION&gt;`, for convenience with
>  third-party services that use such strings in environment variables.

>CSRF
>~~~~

>* Added the :setting:`CSRF_USE_SESSIONS` setting to allow storing the CSRF
>  token in the user&#39;s session rather than in a cookie.

>Database backends
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>* Added the ``skip_locked`` argument to :meth:`.QuerySet.select_for_update()`
>  on PostgreSQL 9.5+ and Oracle to execute queries with
>  ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``.

>* Added the :setting:`TEST[&#39;TEMPLATE&#39;] &lt;TEST_TEMPLATE&gt;` setting to let
>  PostgreSQL users specify a template for creating the test database.

>* :meth:`.QuerySet.iterator()` now uses :ref:`server-side cursors
>  &lt;psycopg2:server-side-cursors&gt;` on PostgreSQL. This feature transfers some of
>  the worker memory load (used to hold query results) to the database and might
>  increase database memory usage.

>* Added MySQL support for the ``&#39;isolation_level&#39;`` option in
>  :setting:`OPTIONS` to allow specifying the :ref:`transaction isolation level
>  &lt;mysql-isolation-level&gt;`. To avoid possible data loss, it&#39;s recommended to
>  switch from MySQL&#39;s default level, repeatable read, to read committed.

>* Added support for ``cx_Oracle`` 5.3.

>Email
>~~~~~

>* Added the :setting:`EMAIL_USE_LOCALTIME` setting to allow sending SMTP date
>  headers in the local time zone rather than in UTC.

>* ``EmailMessage.attach()`` and ``attach_file()`` now fall back to MIME type
>  ``application/octet-stream`` when binary content that can&#39;t be decoded as
>  UTF-8 is specified for a ``text/*`` attachment.

>File Storage
>~~~~~~~~~~~~

>* To make it wrappable by :class:`io.TextIOWrapper`,
>  :class:`~django.core.files.File` now has the ``readable()``, ``writable()``,
>  and ``seekable()`` methods.

>Forms
>~~~~~

>* The new :attr:`CharField.empty_value &lt;django.forms.CharField.empty_value&gt;`
>  attribute allows specifying the Python value to use to represent &quot;empty&quot;.

>* The new :meth:`Form.get_initial_for_field()
>  &lt;django.forms.Form.get_initial_for_field&gt;` method returns initial data for a
>  form field.

>Internationalization
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>* Number formatting and the :setting:`NUMBER_GROUPING` setting support
>  non-uniform digit grouping.

>Management Commands
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>* The new :option:`loaddata --exclude` option allows excluding models and apps
>  while loading data from fixtures.

>* The new :option:`diffsettings --default` option allows specifying a settings
>  module other than Django&#39;s default settings to compare against.

>* ``app_label``\s arguments now limit the :option:`showmigrations --plan`
>  output.

>Migrations
>~~~~~~~~~~

>* Added support for serialization of ``uuid.UUID`` objects.

>Models
>~~~~~~

>* Added support for callable values in the ``defaults`` argument of
>  :meth:`QuerySet.update_or_create()
>  &lt;django.db.models.query.QuerySet.update_or_create&gt;` and
>  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.get_or_create`.

>* :class:`~django.db.models.ImageField` now has a default
>  :data:`~django.core.validators.validate_image_file_extension` validator.
>  (This validator moved to the form field in :doc:`Django 1.11.2 &lt;1.11.2&gt;`.)

>* Added support for time truncation to
>  :class:`~django.db.models.functions.datetime.Trunc` functions.

>* Added the :class:`~django.db.models.functions.datetime.ExtractWeek` function
>  to extract the week from :class:`~django.db.models.DateField` and
>  :class:`~django.db.models.DateTimeField` and exposed it through the
>  :lookup:`week` lookup.

>* Added the :class:`~django.db.models.functions.datetime.TruncTime` function
>  to truncate :class:`~django.db.models.DateTimeField` to its time component
>  and exposed it through the :lookup:`time` lookup.

>* Added support for expressions in :meth:`.QuerySet.values` and
>  :meth:`~.QuerySet.values_list`.

>* Added support for query expressions on lookups that take multiple arguments,
>  such as ``range``.

>* You can now use the ``unique=True`` option with
>  :class:`~django.db.models.FileField`.

>* Added the ``nulls_first`` and ``nulls_last`` parameters to
>  :class:`Expression.asc() &lt;django.db.models.Expression.asc&gt;` and
>  :meth:`~django.db.models.Expression.desc` to control
>  the ordering of null values.

>* The new ``F`` expression ``bitleftshift()`` and ``bitrightshift()`` methods
>  allow :ref:`bitwise shift operations &lt;using-f-expressions-in-filters&gt;`.

>* Added :meth:`.QuerySet.union`, :meth:`~.QuerySet.intersection`, and
>  :meth:`~.QuerySet.difference`.

>Requests and Responses
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>* Added :meth:`QueryDict.fromkeys() &lt;django.http.QueryDict.fromkeys&gt;`.

>* :class:`~django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware` now sets the
>  ``Content-Length`` response header for non-streaming responses.

>* Added the :setting:`SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD` setting to allow appending the
>  ``preload`` directive to the ``Strict-Transport-Security`` header.

>* :class:`~django.middleware.http.ConditionalGetMiddleware` now adds the
>  ``ETag`` header to responses.

>Serialization
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>* The new ``django.core.serializers.base.Serializer.stream_class`` attribute
>  allows subclasses to customize the default stream.

>* The encoder used by the :ref:`JSON serializer &lt;serialization-formats-json&gt;`
>  can now be customized by passing a ``cls`` keyword argument to the
>  ``serializers.serialize()`` function.

>* :class:`~django.core.serializers.json.DjangoJSONEncoder` now serializes
>  :class:`~datetime.timedelta` objects (used by
>  :class:`~django.db.models.DurationField`).

>Templates
>~~~~~~~~~

>* :meth:`~django.utils.safestring.mark_safe` can now be used as a decorator.

>* The :class:`~django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2` template backend now
>  supports context processors by setting the ``&#39;context_processors&#39;`` option in
>  :setting:`OPTIONS &lt;TEMPLATES-OPTIONS&gt;`.

>* The :ttag:`regroup` tag now returns ``namedtuple``\s instead of dictionaries
>  so you can unpack the group object directly in a loop, e.g.
>  ``{% for grouper, list in regrouped %}``.

>* Added a :ttag:`resetcycle` template tag to allow resetting the sequence of
>  the :ttag:`cycle` template tag.

>* You can now specify specific directories for a particular
>  :class:`filesystem.Loader &lt;django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader&gt;`.

>Tests
>~~~~~

>* Added :meth:`.DiscoverRunner.get_test_runner_kwargs` to allow customizing the
>  keyword arguments passed to the test runner.

>* Added the :option:`test --debug-mode` option to help troubleshoot test
>  failures by setting the :setting:`DEBUG` setting to ``True``.

>* The new :func:`django.test.utils.setup_databases` (moved from
>  ``django.test.runner``) and :func:`~django.test.utils.teardown_databases`
>  functions make it easier to build custom test runners.

>* Added support for :meth:`python:unittest.TestCase.subTest`’s when using the
>  :option:`test --parallel` option.

>* ``DiscoverRunner`` now runs the system checks at the start of a test run.
>  Override the :meth:`.DiscoverRunner.run_checks` method if you want to disable
>  that.

>Validators
>~~~~~~~~~~

>* Added :class:`~django.core.validators.FileExtensionValidator` to validate
>  file extensions and
>  :data:`~django.core.validators.validate_image_file_extension` to validate
>  image files.

>.. _backwards-incompatible-1.11:

>Backwards incompatible changes in 1.11
>======================================

>:mod:`django.contrib.gis`
>-------------------------

>* To simplify the codebase and because it&#39;s easier to install than when
>  ``contrib.gis`` was first released, :ref:`gdalbuild` is now a required
>  dependency for GeoDjango. In older versions, it&#39;s only required for SQLite.

>* ``contrib.gis.maps`` is removed as it interfaces with a retired version of
>  the Google Maps API and seems to be unmaintained. If you&#39;re using it, `let
>  us know &lt;https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/14284&gt;`_.

>* The ``GEOSGeometry`` equality operator now also compares SRID.

>* The OpenLayers-based form widgets now use OpenLayers 3, and the
>  ``gis/openlayers.html`` and ``gis/openlayers-osm.html`` templates have been
>  updated. Check your project if you subclass these widgets or extend the
>  templates. Also, the new widgets work a bit differently than the old ones.
>  Instead of using a toolbar in the widget, you click to draw, click and drag
>  to move the map, and click and drag a point/vertex/corner to move it.

>* Support for SpatiaLite &lt; 4.0 is dropped.

>* Support for GDAL 1.7 and 1.8 is dropped.

>* The widgets in ``contrib.gis.forms.widgets`` and the admin&#39;s
>  ``OpenLayersWidget`` use the :doc:`form rendering API &lt;/ref/forms/renderers&gt;`
>  rather than ``loader.render_to_string()``. If you&#39;re using a custom widget
>  template, you&#39;ll need to be sure your form renderer can locate it. For
>  example, you could use the :class:`~django.forms.renderers.TemplatesSetting`
>  renderer.

>:mod:`django.contrib.staticfiles`
>---------------------------------

>* ``collectstatic`` may now fail during post-processing when using a hashed
>  static files storage if a reference loop exists (e.g. ``&#39;foo.css&#39;``
>  references ``&#39;bar.css&#39;`` which itself references ``&#39;foo.css&#39;``) or if the
>  chain of files referencing other files is too deep to resolve in several
>  passes. In the latter case, increase the number of passes using
>  :attr:`.ManifestStaticFilesStorage.max_post_process_passes`.

>* When using ``ManifestStaticFilesStorage``, static files not found in the
>  manifest at runtime now raise a ``ValueError`` instead of returning an
>  unchanged path. You can revert to the old behavior by setting
>  :attr:`.ManifestStaticFilesStorage.manifest_strict` to ``False``.

>Database backend API
>--------------------

>This section describes changes that may be needed in third-party database
>backends.

>* The ``DatabaseOperations.time_trunc_sql()`` method is added to support
>  ``TimeField`` truncation. It accepts a ``lookup_type`` and ``field_name``
>  arguments and returns the appropriate SQL to truncate the given time field
>  ``field_name`` to a time object with only the given specificity. The
>  ``lookup_type`` argument can be either ``&#39;hour&#39;``, ``&#39;minute&#39;``, or
>  ``&#39;second&#39;``.

>* The ``DatabaseOperations.datetime_cast_time_sql()`` method is added to
>  support the :lookup:`time` lookup. It accepts a ``field_name`` and ``tzname``
>  arguments and returns the SQL necessary to cast a datetime value to time value.

>* To enable ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` support, set
>  ``DatabaseFeatures.has_select_for_update_skip_locked = True``.

>* The new ``DatabaseFeatures.supports_index_column_ordering`` attribute
>  specifies if a database allows defining ordering for columns in indexes. The
>  default value is ``True`` and the ``DatabaseIntrospection.get_constraints()``
>  method should include an ``&#39;orders&#39;`` key in each of the returned
>  dictionaries with a list of ``&#39;ASC&#39;`` and/or ``&#39;DESC&#39;`` values corresponding
>  to the the ordering of each column in the index.

>* :djadmin:`inspectdb` no longer calls ``DatabaseIntrospection.get_indexes()``
>  which is deprecated. Custom database backends should ensure all types of
>  indexes are returned by ``DatabaseIntrospection.get_constraints()``.

>* Renamed the ``ignores_quoted_identifier_case`` feature to
>  ``ignores_table_name_case`` to more accurately reflect how it is used.

>* The ``name`` keyword argument is added to the
>  ``DatabaseWrapper.create_cursor(self, name=None)`` method to allow usage of
>  server-side cursors on backends that support it.

>Dropped support for PostgreSQL 9.2 and PostGIS 2.0
>--------------------------------------------------

>Upstream support for PostgreSQL 9.2 ends in September 2017. As a consequence,
>Django 1.11 sets PostgreSQL 9.3 as the minimum version it officially supports.

>Support for PostGIS 2.0 is also removed as PostgreSQL 9.2 is the last version
>to support it.

>Also, the minimum supported version of psycopg2 is increased from 2.4.5 to
>2.5.4.

>.. _liveservertestcase-port-zero-change:

>``LiveServerTestCase`` binds to port zero
>-----------------------------------------

>Rather than taking a port range and iterating to find a free port,
>``LiveServerTestCase`` binds to port zero and relies on the operating system
>to assign a free port. The ``DJANGO_LIVE_TEST_SERVER_ADDRESS`` environment
>variable is no longer used, and as it&#39;s also no longer used, the
>``manage.py test --liveserver`` option is removed.

>If you need to bind ``LiveServerTestCase`` to a specific port, use the ``port``
>attribute added in Django 1.11.2.

>Protection against insecure redirects in :mod:`django.contrib.auth` and ``i18n`` views
>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>``LoginView``, ``LogoutView`` (and the deprecated function-based equivalents),
>and :func:`~django.views.i18n.set_language` protect users from being redirected
>to non-HTTPS ``next`` URLs when the app is running over HTTPS.

>``QuerySet.get_or_create()`` and ``update_or_create()`` validate arguments
>--------------------------------------------------------------------------

>To prevent typos from passing silently,
>:meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.get_or_create` and
>:meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.update_or_create` check that their
>arguments are model fields. This should be backwards-incompatible only in the
>fact that it might expose a bug in your project.

>``pytz`` is a required dependency and support for ``settings.TIME_ZONE = None`` is removed
>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>To simplify Django&#39;s timezone handling, ``pytz`` is now a required dependency.
>It&#39;s automatically installed along with Django.

>Support for ``settings.TIME_ZONE = None`` is removed as the behavior isn&#39;t
>commonly used and is questionably useful. If you want to automatically detect
>the timezone based on the system timezone, you can use `tzlocal
>&lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tzlocal&gt;`_::

>    from tzlocal import get_localzone

>    TIME_ZONE = get_localzone().zone

>This works similar to ``settings.TIME_ZONE = None`` except that it also sets
>``os.environ[&#39;TZ&#39;]``. `Let us know
>&lt;https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/OAV3FChfuPM/discussion&gt;`__
>if there&#39;s a use case where you find you can&#39;t adapt your code to set a
>``TIME_ZONE``.

>HTML changes in admin templates
>-------------------------------

>``&lt;p class=&quot;help&quot;&gt;`` is replaced with a ``&lt;div&gt;`` tag to allow including lists
>inside help text.

>Read-only fields are wrapped in ``&lt;div class=&quot;readonly&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;`` instead of
>``&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;`` to allow any kind of HTML as the field&#39;s content.

>.. _template-widget-incompatibilities-1-11:

>Changes due to the introduction of template-based widget rendering
>------------------------------------------------------------------

>Some undocumented classes in ``django.forms.widgets`` are removed:

>* ``SubWidget``
>* ``RendererMixin``, ``ChoiceFieldRenderer``, ``RadioFieldRenderer``,
>  ``CheckboxFieldRenderer``
>* ``ChoiceInput``, ``RadioChoiceInput``, ``CheckboxChoiceInput``

>The undocumented ``Select.render_option()`` method is removed.

>The ``Widget.format_output()`` method is removed. Use a custom widget template
>instead.

>Some widget values, such as ``&lt;select&gt;`` options, are now localized if
>``settings.USE_L10N=True``. You could revert to the old behavior with custom
>widget templates that uses the :ttag:`localize` template tag to turn off
>localization.

>``django.template.backends.django.Template.render()`` prohibits non-dict context
>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>For compatibility with multiple template engines,
>``django.template.backends.django.Template.render()`` (returned from high-level
>template loader APIs such as ``loader.get_template()``) must receive a
>dictionary of context rather than ``Context`` or ``RequestContext``. If you
>were passing either of the two classes, pass a dictionary instead -- doing so
>is backwards-compatible with older versions of Django.

>Model state changes in migration operations
>-------------------------------------------

>To improve the speed of applying migrations, rendering of related models is
>delayed until an operation that needs them (e.g. ``RunPython``). If you have a
>custom operation that works with model classes or model instances from the
>``from_state`` argument in ``database_forwards()`` or ``database_backwards()``,
>you must render model states using the ``clear_delayed_apps_cache()`` method as
>described in :ref:`writing your own migration operation
>&lt;writing-your-own-migration-operation&gt;`.

>Miscellaneous
>-------------

>* If no items in the feed have a ``pubdate`` or ``updateddate`` attribute,
>  :meth:`SyndicationFeed.latest_post_date()
>  &lt;django.utils.feedgenerator.SyndicationFeed.latest_post_date&gt;` now returns
>  the current UTC date/time, instead of a datetime without any timezone
>  information.

>* CSRF failures are logged to the ``django.security.csrf`` logger instead of
>  ``django.request``.

>* :setting:`ALLOWED_HOSTS` validation is no longer disabled when running tests.
>  If your application includes tests with custom host names, you must include
>  those host names in :setting:`ALLOWED_HOSTS`. See
>  :ref:`topics-testing-advanced-multiple-hosts`.

>* Using a foreign key&#39;s id (e.g. ``&#39;field_id&#39;``) in ``ModelAdmin.list_display``
>  displays the related object&#39;s ID. Remove the ``_id`` suffix if you want the
>  old behavior of the string representation of the object.

>* In model forms, :class:`~django.db.models.CharField` with ``null=True`` now
>  saves ``NULL`` for blank values instead of empty strings.

>* On Oracle, :meth:`Model.validate_unique()
>  &lt;django.db.models.Model.validate_unique&gt;` no longer checks empty strings for
>  uniqueness as the database interprets the value as ``NULL``.

>* If you subclass :class:`.AbstractUser` and override ``clean()``, be sure it
>  calls ``super()``. :meth:`.BaseUserManager.normalize_email` is called in a
>  new :meth:`.AbstractUser.clean` method so that normalization is applied in
>  cases like model form validation.

>* ``EmailField`` and ``URLField`` no longer accept the ``strip`` keyword
>  argument. Remove it because it doesn&#39;t have an effect in older versions of
>  Django as these fields always strip whitespace.

>* The ``checked`` and ``selected`` attribute rendered by form widgets now uses
>  HTML5 boolean syntax rather than XHTML&#39;s ``checked=&#39;checked&#39;`` and
>  ``selected=&#39;selected&#39;``.

>* :meth:`RelatedManager.add()
>  &lt;django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager.add&gt;`,
>  :meth:`~django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager.remove`,
>  :meth:`~django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager.clear`, and
>  :meth:`~django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager.set` now
>  clear the ``prefetch_related()`` cache.

>* To prevent possible loss of saved settings,
>  :func:`~django.test.utils.setup_test_environment` now raises an exception if
>  called a second time before calling
>  :func:`~django.test.utils.teardown_test_environment`.

>* The undocumented ``DateTimeAwareJSONEncoder`` alias for
>  :class:`~django.core.serializers.json.DjangoJSONEncoder` (renamed in Django
>  1.0) is removed.

>* The :class:`cached template loader &lt;django.template.loaders.cached.Loader&gt;`
>  is now enabled if :setting:`DEBUG` is ``False`` and
>  :setting:`OPTIONS[&#39;loaders&#39;] &lt;TEMPLATES-OPTIONS&gt;` isn&#39;t specified. This could
>  be backwards-incompatible if you have some :ref:`template tags that aren&#39;t
>  thread safe &lt;template_tag_thread_safety&gt;`.

>* The prompt for stale content type deletion no longer occurs after running the
>  ``migrate`` command. Use the new :djadmin:`remove_stale_contenttypes` command
>  instead.

>* The admin&#39;s widget for ``IntegerField`` uses ``type=&quot;number&quot;`` rather than
>  ``type=&quot;text&quot;``.

>* Conditional HTTP headers are now parsed and compared according to the
>  :rfc:`7232` Conditional Requests specification rather than the older
>  :rfc:`2616`.

>* :func:`~django.utils.cache.patch_response_headers` no longer adds a
>  ``Last-Modified`` header. According to the :rfc:`7234section-4.2.2`, this
>  header is useless alongside other caching headers that provide an explicit
>  expiration time, e.g. ``Expires`` or ``Cache-Control``.
>  :class:`~django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware` and
>  :func:`~django.utils.cache.add_never_cache_headers` call
>  ``patch_response_headers()`` and therefore are also affected by this change.

>* In the admin templates, ``&lt;p class=&quot;help&quot;&gt;`` is replaced with a ``&lt;div&gt;`` tag
>  to allow including lists inside help text.

>* :class:`~django.middleware.http.ConditionalGetMiddleware` no longer sets the
>  ``Date`` header as Web servers set that header. It also no longer sets the
>  ``Content-Length`` header as this is now done by
>  :class:`~django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware`.

>* :meth:`~django.apps.AppConfig.get_model` and
>  :meth:`~django.apps.AppConfig.get_models` now raise
>  :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady` if they&#39;re called before
>  models of all applications have been loaded. Previously they only required
>  the target application&#39;s models to be loaded and thus could return models
>  without all their relations set up. If you need the old behavior of
>  ``get_model()``, set the ``require_ready`` argument to ``False``.

>* The unused ``BaseCommand.can_import_settings`` attribute is removed.

>* The undocumented ``django.utils.functional.lazy_property`` is removed.

>* For consistency with non-multipart requests, ``MultiPartParser.parse()`` now
>  leaves ``request.POST`` immutable. If you&#39;re modifying that ``QueryDict``,
>  you must now first copy it, e.g. ``request.POST.copy()``.

>* Support for ``cx_Oracle`` &lt; 5.2 is removed.

>* Support for IPython &lt; 1.0 is removed from the ``shell`` command.

>* The signature of private API ``Widget.build_attrs()`` changed from
>  ``extra_attrs=None, **kwargs`` to ``base_attrs, extra_attrs=None``.

>* File-like objects (e.g., :class:`~io.StringIO` and :class:`~io.BytesIO`)
>  uploaded to an :class:`~django.db.models.ImageField` using the test client
>  now require a ``name`` attribute with a value that passes the
>  :data:`~django.core.validators.validate_image_file_extension` validator.
>  See the note in :meth:`.Client.post`.

>.. _deprecated-features-1.11:

>Features deprecated in 1.11
>===========================

>``models.permalink()`` decorator
>--------------------------------

>Use :func:`django.urls.reverse` instead. For example::

>    from django.db import models

>    class MyModel(models.Model):
>        ...

>        models.permalink
>        def url(self):
>            return (&#39;guitarist_detail&#39;, [self.slug])

>becomes::

>    from django.db import models
>    from django.urls import reverse

>    class MyModel(models.Model):
>        ...

>        def url(self):
>            return reverse(&#39;guitarist_detail&#39;, args=[self.slug])

>Miscellaneous
>-------------

>* ``contrib.auth``’s ``login()`` and ``logout()`` function-based views are
>  deprecated in favor of new class-based views
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView` and
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.LogoutView`.

>* The unused ``extra_context`` parameter of
>  ``contrib.auth.views.logout_then_login()``  is deprecated.

>* ``contrib.auth``’s ``password_change()``, ``password_change_done()``,
>  ``password_reset()``, ``password_reset_done()``, ``password_reset_confirm()``,
>  and ``password_reset_complete()`` function-based views are deprecated in favor
>  of new class-based views
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordChangeView`,
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordChangeDoneView`,
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetView`,
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetDoneView`,
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetConfirmView`, and
>  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetCompleteView`.

>* ``django.test.runner.setup_databases()`` is moved to
>  :func:`django.test.utils.setup_databases`. The old location is deprecated.

>* ``django.utils.translation.string_concat()`` is deprecated in
>  favor of :func:`django.utils.text.format_lazy`. ``string_concat(*strings)``
>  can be replaced by ``format_lazy(&#39;{}&#39; * len(strings), *strings)``.

>* For the ``PyLibMCCache`` cache backend, passing ``pylibmc`` behavior settings
>  as top-level attributes of ``OPTIONS`` is deprecated. Set them under a
>  ``behaviors`` key within ``OPTIONS`` instead.

>* The ``host`` parameter of ``django.utils.http.is_safe_url()`` is deprecated
>  in favor of the new ``allowed_hosts`` parameter.

>* Silencing exceptions raised while rendering the
>  :ttag:`{% include %} &lt;include&gt;` template tag is deprecated as the behavior is
>  often more confusing than helpful. In Django 2.1, the exception will be
>  raised.

>* ``DatabaseIntrospection.get_indexes()`` is deprecated in favor of
>  ``DatabaseIntrospection.get_constraints()``.

>* :func:`~django.contrib.auth.authenticate` now passes a ``request`` argument
>  to the ``authenticate()`` method of authentication backends. Support for
>  methods that don&#39;t accept ``request`` as the first positional argument will
>  be removed in Django 2.1.

>* The ``USE_ETAGS`` setting is deprecated in favor of
>  :class:`~django.middleware.http.ConditionalGetMiddleware` which now adds the
>  ``ETag`` header to responses regardless of the setting. ``CommonMiddleware``
>  and ``django.utils.cache.patch_response_headers()`` will no longer set ETags
>  when the deprecation ends.

>* ``Model._meta.has_auto_field`` is deprecated in favor of checking if
>  ``Model._meta.auto_field is not None``.

>* Using regular expression groups with ``iLmsu`` in ``url()`` is deprecated.
>  The only group that&#39;s useful is ``(?i)`` for case-insensitive URLs, however,
>  case-insensitive URLs aren&#39;t a good practice because they create multiple
>  entries for search engines, for example. An alternative solution could be to
>  create a :data:`~django.conf.urls.handler404` that looks for uppercase
>  characters in the URL and redirects to a lowercase equivalent.

>* The ``renderer`` argument is added to the :meth:`Widget.render()
>  &lt;django.forms.Widget.render&gt;` method. Methods that don&#39;t accept that argument
>  will work through a deprecation period.
