<blockquote>
<h2>v4.7.7 - February 15th, 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>fix weird error in integration tests - eb860c0</li>
<li>fix: check prototype property access in strict-mode (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1736"">#1736</a>) - b6d3de7</li>
<li>fix: escape property names in compat mode (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1736"">#1736</a>) - f058970</li>
<li>refactor: In spec tests, use expectTemplate over equals and shouldThrow (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1683"">#1683</a>) - 77825f8</li>
<li>chore: start testing on Node.js 12 and 13 - 3789a30</li>
</ul>
<p>(POSSIBLY) BREAKING CHANGES:</p>
<ul>
<li>the changes from version <a href=""https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md#v460---january-8th-2020"">4.6.0</a> now also apply
in when using the compile-option &quot;strict: true&quot;. Access to prototype properties is forbidden completely by default, specific properties or methods
can be allowed via runtime-options. See <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1633"">#1633</a> for details. If you are using Handlebars as documented, you should not be accessing prototype properties
from your template anyway, so the changes should not be a problem for you. Only the use of undocumented features can break your build.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why we only bump the patch version despite mentioning breaking changes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3.2 - 2020-10-25</p>
<pre><code>
* **SECURITY ISSUE:** Attempted to make RSA PKCS#1v1.5 decryption more constant
  time, to protect against Bleichenbacher vulnerabilities. Due to limitations
  imposed by our API, we cannot completely mitigate this vulnerability and a
  future release will contain a new API which is designed to be resilient to
  these for contexts where it is required. Credit to **Hubert Kario** for
  reporting the issue. *CVE-2020-25659*
* Support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 has been removed. Users on older version of OpenSSL
  will need to upgrade.
* Added basic support for PKCS7 signing (including SMIME) via
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.PKCS7SignatureBuilder`.
<p>.. _v3-1-1:</p>
<p>3.1.1 - 2020-09-22
</code></pre></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Windows, macOS, and <code>manylinux</code> wheels to be compiled with
OpenSSL 1.1.1h.</li>
</ul>
<p>.. _v3-1:</p>
<p>3.1 - 2020-08-26</p>
<pre><code>
* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Removed support for ``idna`` based
  :term:`U-label` parsing in various X.509 classes. This support was originally
  deprecated in version 2.1 and moved to an extra in 2.5.
* Deprecated OpenSSL 1.0.2 support. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is no longer supported by
  the OpenSSL project. The next version of ``cryptography`` will drop support
  for it.
* Deprecated support for Python 3.5. This version sees very little use and will
  be removed in the next release.
* ``backend`` arguments to functions are no longer required and the
  default backend will automatically be selected if no ``backend`` is provided.
* Added initial support for parsing certificates from PKCS7 files with
  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`
  and
  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`
  .
* Calling ``update`` or ``update_into`` on
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext` with ``data``
  longer than 2\ :sup:`31` bytes no longer raises an ``OverflowError``. This
  also resolves the same issue in :doc:`/fernet`.
<p>.. _v3-0:

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add ""no-prototype-builtins"" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of ""properties that must be enumerable"".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the ""lookup""-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.
>
