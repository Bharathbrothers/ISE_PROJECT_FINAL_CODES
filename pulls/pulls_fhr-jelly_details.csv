The data collected and reported for the health report (base data, opt-out data for the release population) remains essentially the same; the UX presented to the user remains essentially the same.

We'll have both older and newer clients out in the wild for some time, so we need to host two versions of this content, which make use of the two APIs. Our proposal is to create a 'v4' version of the site that mirrors the files at the root directory, with minor changes. URLs then become:
fhr v2:  https://fhr.cdn.mozilla.net/%LOCALE%/
mobile:  https://fhr.cdn.mozilla.net/%LOCALE%/mobile/
unified telemetry/fhr v4:  https://fhr.cdn.mozilla.net/%LOCALE%/v4/

This PR currently copies the various files into the static v4 directory, and then sets up symlinks in the various locale directories (following the same pattern as the v2/html files).

It does not yet copy a new index or js files. (@bsmedberg will make the API changes.) Pushing this as is would allow us to go ahead and patch the client with the new v4 url. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1180673

So, I do not know if my Python is as Pythonic as it can be and I need some feedback also from Pascal regarding the l10n hooks but, all in all, it works.

The generate script now takes a new parameter called --platform that can either be desktop or mobile. If you do not pass anything, it defaults to desktop. Also, if you do not specify a output-dir it will write to a build directory at the root of the repo as such:

```
/build

Bit tricky to test.

1) Just load the page and nothing weird or new should happen.
2) Duplicate the list item under  <ul id=""carousel""> and then load up the page again.

With number 2, the tips should cycle through the two tips at a rate of 5 seconds per tip.

This is the simple version 1,we can work from here to add features etc. if need be.
