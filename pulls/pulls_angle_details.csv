The pattern of gen context, share context, free context, then allocate
a shared GL object in the second context would cause a use-after-free

storing the factory pointer. This allows the same ResourceManager to
work with separate Context implementations, which will work with
non-virtual contexts.

tests.  get*Bits will now only return greater than zero bit counts when
