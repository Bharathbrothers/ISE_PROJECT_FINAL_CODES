I did not fix some URLs in /apps/jetpack/fixtures/core_sdk.json , not knowing whether this was just historical (or what it was for), whereas with /apps/jetpack/templates/js/first_addon.js , I changed the URLs as it looked like the widget might still work today, though I didn't test it (and it also used the ""new"" keyword in front of Widget which I guess is no longer necessary).

Even if this is imperfect, I really suggest addressing this quickly as the whole site is kind of meaningless if one can't find the docs (though ""Submit to AMO"" is another critical item to make the site worthwhile but at least one can still test without it if one can find the docs).

Here's my removal of the cfx.sh script from the build process.

To everybody else, Mozilla has a lot of projects, but I think you can opt out of notifications by simply following a few specific projects and not ""watching"" Mozilla overall... but then again I could be wrong and github might be your inbox's newest BFF.

Sincerely,

Dave
