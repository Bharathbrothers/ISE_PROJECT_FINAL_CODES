Note that test_edit_profile_change_display_name has been failing on staging [1] due to the default username for the user being changed (likely as a result of this test failing before). We could ""fix"" this by just updating the username for the user on staging, but it's a bad idea to have a test that depends on data being in a specific state before the test is run (data that we are not controlling via the test), so I think this fix should be implemented.

The problem was occurring intermittently in my testing. 

This change to the parent locator fixed the issue for me. I suggest we hold off on this pull request until we see whether CI had issues with the test after we upgrade to Se 2.35.  If we don't see any issues, we can close this pull request.

Note that merging this will cause the tests to fail on stage and prod. I'm not sure if the problem is that dev is inaccurate because it is out of sync with stage/prod, or that the change hasn't been pushed yet to stage/prod from dev.

What is the best way to deal with changes like this, that cause tests to fail on one platform but not others? Conditionally xfailing seems like a lot of work/maintenance.
