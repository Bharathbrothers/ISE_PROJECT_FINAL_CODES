Here's something that might help with the CPU usage issue identified in https://github.com/mozilla/browserid-verifier/issues/80.  The current code checks for and validates proxy-related environment variables on every remote request.  This version generates a specialized checking function based on the current env var values, and only changes it if it finds that the env vars have mysteriously changed.

In a simple local test calling `shouldUseProxy` 1000000 times in a loop, this version is very slightly slower when there's no `HTTPS_PROXY` env var, and more than five times faster when there is.

Kinda complicated, but good fun and might be worth it to save a few pennies a day :-P
