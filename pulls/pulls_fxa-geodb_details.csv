Anyways, this crash means that content server on `latest`, etc., can no longer start, as it tries to load ENOENT on startup.

11,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fxa-geodb/pulls/32,32,feat(api): return location object directly instead of in a promise,"Fixes #30.

The core functionality of this repo isn't asynchronous, so there's no reason to return a promise. And because promises ripple outwards, returning a promise has led to some ugly code in the auth server, where we expose the result on the request object. Everywhere we use it has to do this:

```js
request.app.geo.then(geoData => {
  // use geoData...
});
```

It would be much nicer if we could just use `request.app.geo` directly, hence this PR.

Obviously, ditching promises is a breaking change to the API, so I've included a major version bump. And CI has been updated to run on node 6 and 8, too.

This PR also includes the test fix from #31, so I'll close that one and we can just bring the fix in here instead.
