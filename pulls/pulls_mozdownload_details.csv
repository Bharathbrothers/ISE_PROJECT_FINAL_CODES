### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   Compatiblity (BREAKING CHANGES)

*  We have now dropped support for End-Of-Life&#39;d versions of Python and
   particularly old versions of the `coverage` library; if you are still using
   Python v2.7 or v3.4, or you are using `coverage&lt;4.1`, this library will no
   longer be compatible starting from this release -- please pin to
   `coveralls&lt;2.0.0`.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add `service_number` for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **3.1.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.1.0
   ```
   ------------------

* New mocker fixtures added that allow using mocking functionality in other scopes:

  * ``class_mocker``
  * ``module_mocker``
  * ``package_mocker``
  * ``session_mocker``

  Added by `scorphus`_ in `182`_.

.. _scorphus: https://github.com/scorphus
.. _182: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/182
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

* Python 2.7 and 3.4 are no longer supported. Users using ``pip 9`` or later will install
  a compatible version automatically.

* ``mocker.spy`` now also works with ``async def`` functions (`179`_). Thanks `frankie567`_ for the PR!

.. _179: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/179
.. _frankie567: https://github.com/frankie567
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.
   ```

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **3.1.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.1.0
   ```
   ------------------

* New mocker fixtures added that allow using mocking functionality in other scopes:

  * ``class_mocker``
  * ``module_mocker``
  * ``package_mocker``
  * ``session_mocker``

  Added by `scorphus`_ in `182`_.

.. _scorphus: https://github.com/scorphus
.. _182: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/182
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

* Python 2.7 and 3.4 are no longer supported. Users using ``pip 9`` or later will install
  a compatible version automatically.

* ``mocker.spy`` now also works with ``async def`` functions (`179`_). Thanks `frankie567`_ for the PR!

.. _179: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/179
.. _frankie567: https://github.com/frankie567
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   Compatiblity (BREAKING CHANGES)

*  We have now dropped support for End-Of-Life&#39;d versions of Python and
   particularly old versions of the `coverage` library; if you are still using
   Python v2.7 or v3.4, or you are using `coverage&lt;4.1`, this library will no
   longer be compatible starting from this release -- please pin to
   `coveralls&lt;2.0.0`.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add `service_number` for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **3.1.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.1.0
   ```
   ------------------

* New mocker fixtures added that allow using mocking functionality in other scopes:

  * ``class_mocker``
  * ``module_mocker``
  * ``package_mocker``
  * ``session_mocker``

  Added by `scorphus`_ in `182`_.

.. _scorphus: https://github.com/scorphus
.. _182: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/182
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

* Python 2.7 and 3.4 are no longer supported. Users using ``pip 9`` or later will install
  a compatible version automatically.

* ``mocker.spy`` now also works with ``async def`` functions (`179`_). Thanks `frankie567`_ for the PR!

.. _179: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/179
.. _frankie567: https://github.com/frankie567
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   Compatiblity (BREAKING CHANGES)

*  We have now dropped support for End-Of-Life&#39;d versions of Python and
   particularly old versions of the `coverage` library; if you are still using
   Python v2.7 or v3.4, or you are using `coverage&lt;4.1`, this library will no
   longer be compatible starting from this release -- please pin to
   `coveralls&lt;2.0.0`.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add `service_number` for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **3.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

* Python 2.7 and 3.4 are no longer supported. Users using ``pip 9`` or later will install
  a compatible version automatically.

* ``mocker.spy`` now also works with ``async def`` functions (`179`_). Thanks `frankie567`_ for the PR!

.. _179: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/179
.. _frankie567: https://github.com/frankie567
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   Compatiblity (BREAKING CHANGES)

*  We have now dropped support for End-Of-Life&#39;d versions of Python and
   particularly old versions of the `coverage` library; if you are still using
   Python v2.7 or v3.4, or you are using `coverage&lt;4.1`, this library will no
   longer be compatible starting from this release -- please pin to
   `coveralls&lt;2.0.0`.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add `service_number` for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **3.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

* Python 2.7 and 3.4 are no longer supported. Users using ``pip 9`` or later will install
  a compatible version automatically.

* ``mocker.spy`` now also works with ``async def`` functions (`179`_). Thanks `frankie567`_ for the PR!

.. _179: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/179
.. _frankie567: https://github.com/frankie567
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **3.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

* Python 2.7 and 3.4 are no longer supported. Users using ``pip 9`` or later will install
  a compatible version automatically.

* ``mocker.spy`` now also works with ``async def`` functions (`179`_). Thanks `frankie567`_ for the PR!

.. _179: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/179
.. _frankie567: https://github.com/frankie567
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **3.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

* Python 2.7 and 3.4 are no longer supported. Users using ``pip 9`` or later will install
  a compatible version automatically.

* ``mocker.spy`` now also works with ``async def`` functions (`179`_). Thanks `frankie567`_ for the PR!

.. _179: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/179
.. _frankie567: https://github.com/frankie567
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

  of the spied method/function.

   ### 1.12.1

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.
   ```

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```

   ```
   ------------------

* Fixed `348 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/348&gt;`_ -

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0

46,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozdownload/pulls/597,597,Enable auth test in test_base_scraper.py,"Fixes #492 

- Adds a custom auth handler and register a route
- Overrides the `decode_basic` method of request.Authentication
  -  uses the right base64 decode function and fixes the bytes/str error
- enables the auth tests

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```

   ```
   ------------------

* Fixed `348 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/348&gt;`_ -

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.
   ```

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```

   ```
   ------------------

* Fixed `348 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/348&gt;`_ -

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [coveralls](https://pypi.org/project/coveralls) from **1.8.1** to **1.11.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  rename to github-actions ([9e65a059](9e65a059))
    This fixes a regression introduced with v1.11.0, which may have prevented
    usage of this library on Github Actions.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.11.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   Fixes

* **github:**  add service_number for github actions ([9f93bd8e](9f93bd8e))
    This should fix support for parallel builds.

 Compatibility

*  Python 2.7 and 3.4 are now officially End-Of-Life&#39;d. Consider them deprecated
   from the perspective of this package -- we&#39;ll remove them in an upcoming
   release (likely the first one which requires non-trivial work to continue
   supporting them!).

&lt;a name=&quot;1.10.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.10.0
   ```
   Features

*  support coverage&gt;=5.0 (214) ([4a917402](4a917402))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.2
   ```
   Bug Fixes

* **github:**  fixup incorrect API usage (209) ([c338cab4](c338cab4))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.1
   ```
   Compatibility

*  this release marks Python 3.8 as officially supported. Earlier versions probably
   supported Python 3.8 too, but now we&#39;re *sure*.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.9.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.9.0
   ```
   Features

* **support:**  support Github Actions CI (207) ([817119c3](817119c3))

 Bug Fixes

* **compatibility:**  fixup coverage.__version__ comparisons (208) ([03a57a9a](03a57a9a))

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.8.2
   ```
   Internal

* **dependencies**: update pass urllib3&lt;1.25 pin, now that that&#39;s fixed.

&lt;a name=&quot;1.8.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   ```

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157

  of the spied method/function.

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

.. _175: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/175
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

.. _169: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/169issuecomment-555729265
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.0
   ```
   -------------------

* Now all patch functions also raise a ``ValueError`` when used
  as a context-manager. Thanks `AlexGascon`_ for the PR (`168`_).

.. _AlexGascon: https://github.com/AlexGascon
.. _168: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/168
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.2
   ```
   -------------------

* The *pytest introspection follows* message is no longer shown
  if there is no pytest introspection (`154`_).
  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report.

* ``mocker`` now raises a ``ValueError`` when used as a context-manager.
  Thanks `binarymason`_ for the PR (`165`_).

.. _154: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/154
.. _165: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/pull/165
.. _binarymason: https://github.com/binarymason
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix ``mocker.spy`` on Python 2 when used on non-function objects
  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

.. _157: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/issues/157
.. _pbasista: https://github.com/pbasista
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.11.0
   ```
   ------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks the return value
  of the spied method/function.

### Update [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock) from **1.10.4** to **2.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``mocker.spy`` attributes for tracking returned values and raised exceptions of its spied functions
  are now called ``spy_return`` and ``spy_exception``, instead of reusing the existing
  ``MagicMock`` attributes ``return_value`` and ``side_effect``.

  Version ``1.13`` introduced a serious regression: after a spied function using ``mocker.spy``
  raises an exception, further calls to the spy will not call the spied function,
  always raising the first exception instead: assigning to ``side_effect`` causes
  ``unittest.mock`` to behave this way (`175`_).

* The deprecated ``mock`` alias to the ``mocker`` fixture has finally been removed.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.13.0
   ```
   -------------------

* The object returned by ``mocker.spy`` now also tracks any side effect
  of the spied method/function.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.12.1
   ```
   -------------------

* Fix error if ``mocker.patch`` is used in code where the source file
  is not available, for example stale ``.pyc`` files (`169`_).

   -------------------

  which implement ``__call__`` (`157`_). Thanks `pbasista`_  for
  the report.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5206 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5206&gt;`_: Fix ``--nf`` to not forget about known nodeids with partial test selection.


- `5906 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5906&gt;`_: Fix crash with ``KeyboardInterrupt`` during ``--setup-show``.


- `5946 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5946&gt;`_: Fixed issue when parametrizing fixtures with numpy arrays (and possibly other sequence-like types).


- `6044 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6044&gt;`_: Properly ignore ``FileNotFoundError`` exceptions when trying to remove old temporary directories,
  for instance when multiple processes try to remove the same directory (common with ``pytest-xdist``
  for example).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.6.6
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.2**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5206 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5206&gt;`_: Fix ``--nf`` to not forget about known nodeids with partial test selection.


- `5906 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5906&gt;`_: Fix crash with ``KeyboardInterrupt`` during ``--setup-show``.


- `5946 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5946&gt;`_: Fixed issue when parametrizing fixtures with numpy arrays (and possibly other sequence-like types).


- `6044 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6044&gt;`_: Properly ignore ``FileNotFoundError`` exceptions when trying to remove old temporary directories,
  for instance when multiple processes try to remove the same directory (common with ``pytest-xdist``
  for example).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using

- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.

   ### 5.2.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5206 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5206&gt;`_: Fix ``--nf`` to not forget about known nodeids with partial test selection.


- `5906 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5906&gt;`_: Fix crash with ``KeyboardInterrupt`` during ``--setup-show``.


- `5946 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5946&gt;`_: Fixed issue when parametrizing fixtures with numpy arrays (and possibly other sequence-like types).


- `6044 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6044&gt;`_: Properly ignore ``FileNotFoundError`` exceptions when trying to remove old temporary directories,
  for instance when multiple processes try to remove the same directory (common with ``pytest-xdist``
  for example).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.

  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.

   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.

- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.

- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

### Update [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov) from **2.7.1** to **2.8.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.8.1
   ```
   ------------------

* Fixed `348 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/348&gt;`_ -
  regression when only certain reports (html or xml) are used then ``--cov-fail-under`` always fails.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.8.0
   ```
   ------------------

* Fixed ``RecursionError`` that can occur when using
  `cleanup_on_signal &lt;https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess-support.htmlif-you-got-custom-signal-handling&gt;`__ or
  `cleanup_on_sigterm &lt;https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess-support.htmlif-you-got-custom-signal-handling&gt;`__.
  See: `294 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/294&gt;`_.
  The 2.7.x releases of pytest-cov should be considered broken regarding aforementioned cleanup API.
* Added compatibility with future xdist release that deprecates some internals
  (match pytest-xdist master/worker terminology).
  Contributed by Thomas Grainger in `321 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/321&gt;`_
* Fixed breakage that occurs when multiple reporting options are used.
  Contributed by Thomas Grainger in `338 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/338&gt;`_.
* Changed internals to use a stub instead of ``os.devnull``.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.2**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5206 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5206&gt;`_: Fix ``--nf`` to not forget about known nodeids with partial test selection.


- `5906 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5906&gt;`_: Fix crash with ``KeyboardInterrupt`` during ``--setup-show``.


- `5946 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5946&gt;`_: Fixed issue when parametrizing fixtures with numpy arrays (and possibly other sequence-like types).


- `6044 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6044&gt;`_: Properly ignore ``FileNotFoundError`` exceptions when trying to remove old temporary directories,
  for instance when multiple processes try to remove the same directory (common with ``pytest-xdist``
  for example).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using

- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.2**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5206 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5206&gt;`_: Fix ``--nf`` to not forget about known nodeids with partial test selection.


- `5906 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5906&gt;`_: Fix crash with ``KeyboardInterrupt`` during ``--setup-show``.


- `5946 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5946&gt;`_: Fixed issue when parametrizing fixtures with numpy arrays (and possibly other sequence-like types).


- `6044 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6044&gt;`_: Properly ignore ``FileNotFoundError`` exceptions when trying to remove old temporary directories,
  for instance when multiple processes try to remove the same directory (common with ``pytest-xdist``
  for example).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.

  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.8.1
   ```
   ------------------

* Fixed `348 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/348&gt;`_ -

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5206 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5206&gt;`_: Fix ``--nf`` to not forget about known nodeids with partial test selection.


- `5906 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5906&gt;`_: Fix crash with ``KeyboardInterrupt`` during ``--setup-show``.

- `6044 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6044&gt;`_: Properly ignore ``FileNotFoundError`` exceptions when trying to remove old temporary directories,
  for instance when multiple processes try to remove the same directory (common with ``pytest-xdist``
  for example).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

- `5478 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5478&gt;`_: Fix encode error when using unicode strings in exceptions with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.
   ```

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.
   ```

- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.

   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes

  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.

  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.

- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

### Update [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov) from **2.7.1** to **2.8.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2.8.1
   ```
   ------------------

* Fixed `348 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/348&gt;`_ -
  regression when only certain reports (html or xml) are used then ``--cov-fail-under`` always fails.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.8.0
   ```
   ------------------

* Fixed ``RecursionError`` that can occur when using
  `cleanup_on_signal &lt;https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess-support.htmlif-you-got-custom-signal-handling&gt;`__ or
  `cleanup_on_sigterm &lt;https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess-support.htmlif-you-got-custom-signal-handling&gt;`__.
  See: `294 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/294&gt;`_.
  The 2.7.x releases of pytest-cov should be considered broken regarding aforementioned cleanup API.
* Added compatibility with future xdist release that deprecates some internals
  (match pytest-xdist master/worker terminology).
  Contributed by Thomas Grainger in `321 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/321&gt;`_
* Fixed breakage that occurs when multiple reporting options are used.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.

- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

- `5478 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5478&gt;`_: Fix encode error when using unicode strings in exceptions with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.
   ```

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

   ```
   =========================

Deprecations

  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5902 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5902&gt;`_: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs&gt;=19.2``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- `1682 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1682&gt;`_: The ``scope`` parameter of ``pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.htmldynamic-scope&gt;`__ for more information.


- `5764 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5764&gt;`_: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- `5806 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5806&gt;`_: Fix &quot;lexer&quot; being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to &quot;text&quot;.


- `5884 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5884&gt;`_: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5056&gt;`_: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.

- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.2.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

- `5478 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5478&gt;`_: Fix encode error when using unicode strings in exceptions with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.
   ```

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.
   ```

Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5478 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5478&gt;`_: Fix encode error when using unicode strings in exceptions with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.
   ```

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.1.3**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.
   ```

- `5478 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5478&gt;`_: Fix encode error when using unicode strings in exceptions with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.1.3**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.1.3
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5807 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5807&gt;`_: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- `5811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5811&gt;`_: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5819&gt;`_: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by 5792).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.1.2**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.1.2**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.

- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.1.2**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.

- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.

- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.

- `5478 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5478&gt;`_: Fix encode error when using unicode strings in exceptions with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.1.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2270&gt;`_: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- `570 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/570&gt;`_: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- `5782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5782&gt;`_: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- `5786 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5786&gt;`_: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- `5792 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5792&gt;`_: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5751 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751&gt;`_: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.

   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.

  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.

  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,

- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.

- `5478 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5478&gt;`_: Fix encode error when using unicode strings in exceptions with ``pytest.raises``.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.

   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)

Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.

- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.

- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `5180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180&gt;`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__ in the docs.


- `5565 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565&gt;`_: Removed unused support code for `unittest2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/&gt;`__.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn&#39;t seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please
  `file an issue &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new&gt;`__.


- `5615 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615&gt;`_: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``&quot;message&quot;``
  instead of ``u&quot;message&quot;``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- `5564 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564&gt;`_: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- `5576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576&gt;`_: New `NUMBER &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.htmlusing-doctest-options&gt;`__
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault&#39;s `numtest &lt;https://github.com/boisgera/numtest&gt;`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- `5471 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5471&gt;`_: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- `5707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5707&gt;`_: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4344 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4344&gt;`_: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with &quot;__init__.py&quot; only.


- `5115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5115&gt;`_: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- `5477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5477&gt;`_: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``&lt;testsuites&gt;`` root element.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5524 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5524&gt;`_: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- `5537 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5537&gt;`_: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- `5578 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5578&gt;`_: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``pytest.mark.xfail``).


- `5606 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5606&gt;`_: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- `5634 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5634&gt;`_: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest&#39;s pdb correctly.


- `5650 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5650&gt;`_: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- `5701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5701&gt;`_: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- `5734 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5734&gt;`_: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5669&gt;`_: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5095 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5095&gt;`_: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest&#39;s own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- `5516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5516&gt;`_: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- `5603 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5603&gt;`_: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- `5664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5664&gt;`_: When invoking pytest&#39;s own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- `5684 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5684&gt;`_: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert &quot;some message&quot; in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.0.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.



Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.

- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.

- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.0.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.0.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5479 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479&gt;`_: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- `5523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523&gt;`_: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- `5547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547&gt;`_: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517&gt;`_: Improve &quot;Declaring new hooks&quot; section in chapter &quot;Writing Plugins&quot;
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.



Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.

      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;

      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using

          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.


- `5412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412&gt;`_: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.



Deprecations
------------

- `4488 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488&gt;`_: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- `466 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466&gt;`_: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- `3457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457&gt;`_: New `pytest_assertion_pass &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass&gt;`__
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- `5440 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440&gt;`_: The `faulthandler &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html&gt;`__ standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler&gt;`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlfault-handler


- `5452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5452&gt;`_: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- `5125 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5125&gt;`_: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn&#39;t expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1403 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1403&gt;`_: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- `1671 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1671&gt;`_: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- `2761 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2761&gt;`_: Honor PEP 235 on case-insensitive file systems.


- `5078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5078&gt;`_: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- `5260 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5260&gt;`_: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      &gt;       assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E       AssertionError: assert b&#39;spam&#39; == b&#39;eggs&#39;
      E         At index 0 diff: b&#39;s&#39; != b&#39;e&#39;
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- `5335 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5335&gt;`_: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  &#39;%(levelname).Xs&#39; (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- `5354 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5354&gt;`_: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- `5370 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5370&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- `5371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5371&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- `5372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5372&gt;`_: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- `5383 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5383&gt;`_: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- `5389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5389&gt;`_: Fix regressions of `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5063&gt;`__ for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- `5390 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5390&gt;`_: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- `5404 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5404&gt;`_: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (`5080 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5080&gt;`__).


- `5432 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5432&gt;`_: Prevent &quot;already imported&quot; warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- `5433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5433&gt;`_: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- `5444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5444&gt;`_: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- `5482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5482&gt;`_: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- `5505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5505&gt;`_: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5315&gt;`_: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- `5416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5416&gt;`_: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.6.3** to **5.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.

Removals
--------

- `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`_: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues `1149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149&gt;`__,
  `3413 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413&gt;`__, and
  `4009 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009&gt;`__.


- `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`_: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `5402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402&gt;`__.

   ```
   =========================

Important
---------

The ``4.6.X`` series will be the last series to support **Python 2 and Python 3.4**.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html&gt;`__.


Features
--------

- `4559 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4559&gt;`_: Added the ``junit_log_passing_tests`` ini value which can be used to enable or disable logging of passing test output in the Junit XML file.


- `4956 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4956&gt;`_: pytester&#39;s ``testdir.spawn`` uses ``tmpdir`` as HOME/USERPROFILE directory.


- `5062 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5062&gt;`_: Unroll calls to ``all`` to full for-loops with assertion rewriting for better failure messages, especially when using Generator Expressions.


- `5063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5063&gt;`_: Switch from ``pkg_resources`` to ``importlib-metadata`` for entrypoint detection for improved performance and import time.


- `5091 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5091&gt;`_: The output for ini options in ``--help`` has been improved.


- `5269 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5269&gt;`_: ``pytest.importorskip`` includes the ``ImportError`` now in the default ``reason``.


- `5311 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5311&gt;`_: Captured logs that are output for each failing test are formatted using the
  ColoredLevelFormatter.


- `5312 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5312&gt;`_: Improved formatting of multiline log messages in Python 3.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `2064 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2064&gt;`_: The debugging plugin imports the wrapped ``Pdb`` class (``--pdbcls``) on-demand now.


- `4908 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4908&gt;`_: The ``pytest_enter_pdb`` hook gets called with post-mortem (``--pdb``).


- `5036 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5036&gt;`_: Fix issue where fixtures dependent on other parametrized fixtures would be erroneously parametrized.


- `5256 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5256&gt;`_: Handle internal error due to a lone surrogate unicode character not being representable in Jython.


- `5257 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5257&gt;`_: Ensure that ``sys.stdout.mode`` does not include ``&#39;b&#39;`` as it is a text stream.


- `5278 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5278&gt;`_: Pytest&#39;s internal python plugin can be disabled using ``-p no:python`` again.


- `5286 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5286&gt;`_: Fix issue with ``disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support`` option not working when using a list of test IDs in parametrized tests.


- `5330 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5330&gt;`_: Show the test module being collected when emitting ``PytestCollectionWarning`` messages for
  test classes with ``__init__`` and ``__new__`` methods to make it easier to pin down the problem.


- `5333 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5333&gt;`_: Fix regression in 4.5.0 with ``--lf`` not re-running all tests with known failures from non-selected tests.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 4.4.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5089 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5089&gt;`_: Fix crash caused by error in ``__repr__`` function with both ``showlocals`` and verbose output enabled.


- `5139 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5139&gt;`_: Eliminate core dependency on &#39;terminal&#39; plugin.


- `5229 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5229&gt;`_: Require ``pluggy&gt;=0.11.0`` which reverts a dependency to ``importlib-metadata`` added in ``0.10.0``.
  The ``importlib-metadata`` package cannot be imported when installed as an egg and causes issues when relying on ``setup.py`` to install test dependencies.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5171 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5171&gt;`_: Doc: ``pytest_ignore_collect``, ``pytest_collect_directory``, ``pytest_collect_file`` and ``pytest_pycollect_makemodule`` hooks&#39;s &#39;path&#39; parameter documented type is now ``py.path.local``


- `5188 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5188&gt;`_: Improve help for ``--runxfail`` flag.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5182 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5182&gt;`_: Removed internal and unused ``_pytest.deprecated.MARK_INFO_ATTRIBUTE``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5031 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5031&gt;`_: Environment variables are properly restored when using pytester&#39;s ``testdir`` fixture.


- `5039 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5039&gt;`_: Fix regression with ``--pdbcls``, which stopped working with local modules in 4.0.0.


- `5092 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5092&gt;`_: Produce a warning when unknown keywords are passed to ``pytest.param(...)``.


- `5098 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5098&gt;`_: Invalidate import caches with ``monkeypatch.syspath_prepend``, which is required with namespace packages being used.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.4.0** to **4.5.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 4.4.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5089 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5089&gt;`_: Fix crash caused by error in ``__repr__`` function with both ``showlocals`` and verbose output enabled.


- `5139 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5139&gt;`_: Eliminate core dependency on &#39;terminal&#39; plugin.


- `5229 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5229&gt;`_: Require ``pluggy&gt;=0.11.0`` which reverts a dependency to ``importlib-metadata`` added in ``0.10.0``.
  The ``importlib-metadata`` package cannot be imported when installed as an egg and causes issues when relying on ``setup.py`` to install test dependencies.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `5171 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5171&gt;`_: Doc: ``pytest_ignore_collect``, ``pytest_collect_directory``, ``pytest_collect_file`` and ``pytest_pycollect_makemodule`` hooks&#39;s &#39;path&#39; parameter documented type is now ``py.path.local``


- `5188 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5188&gt;`_: Improve help for ``--runxfail`` flag.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `5182 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5182&gt;`_: Removed internal and unused ``_pytest.deprecated.MARK_INFO_ATTRIBUTE``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `5031 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5031&gt;`_: Environment variables are properly restored when using pytester&#39;s ``testdir`` fixture.


- `5039 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5039&gt;`_: Fix regression with ``--pdbcls``, which stopped working with local modules in 4.0.0.


- `5092 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5092&gt;`_: Produce a warning when unknown keywords are passed to ``pytest.param(...)``.


- `5098 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5098&gt;`_: Invalidate import caches with ``monkeypatch.syspath_prepend``, which is required with namespace packages being used.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 4.4.0
   ```
   =========================

Features
--------

- `2224 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2224&gt;`_: ``async`` test functions are skipped and a warning is emitted when a suitable
  async plugin is not installed (such as ``pytest-asyncio`` or ``pytest-trio``).

  Previously ``async`` functions would not execute at all but still be marked as &quot;passed&quot;.


- `2482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2482&gt;`_: Include new ``disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support`` option to disable ascii-escaping in parametrized values. This may cause a series of problems and as the name makes clear, use at your own risk.


- `4718 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4718&gt;`_: The ``-p`` option can now be used to early-load plugins also by entry-point name, instead of just
  by module name.

  This makes it possible to early load external plugins like ``pytest-cov`` in the command-line::

      pytest -p pytest_cov


- `4855 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4855&gt;`_: The ``--pdbcls`` option handles classes via module attributes now (e.g.
  ``pdb:pdb.Pdb`` with `pdb++`_), and its validation was improved.

  .. _pdb++: https://pypi.org/project/pdbpp/


- `4875 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4875&gt;`_: The `testpaths &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.htmlconfval-testpaths&gt;`__ configuration option is now displayed next
  to the ``rootdir`` and ``inifile`` lines in the pytest header if the option is in effect, i.e., directories or file names were
  not explicitly passed in the command line.

  Also, ``inifile`` is only displayed if there&#39;s a configuration file, instead of an empty ``inifile:`` string.


- `4911 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4911&gt;`_: Doctests can be skipped now dynamically using ``pytest.skip()``.


- `4920 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4920&gt;`_: Internal refactorings have been made in order to make the implementation of the
  `pytest-subtests &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-subtests&gt;`__ plugin
  possible, which adds unittest sub-test support and a new ``subtests`` fixture as discussed in
  `1367 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1367&gt;`__.

  For details on the internal refactorings, please see the details on the related PR.


- `4931 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4931&gt;`_: pytester&#39;s ``LineMatcher`` asserts that the passed lines are a sequence.


- `4936 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4936&gt;`_: Handle ``-p plug`` after ``-p no:plug``.

  This can be used to override a blocked plugin (e.g. in &quot;addopts&quot;) from the
  command line etc.


- `4951 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4951&gt;`_: Output capturing is handled correctly when only capturing via fixtures (capsys, capfs) with ``pdb.set_trace()``.


- `4956 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4956&gt;`_: ``pytester`` sets ``$HOME`` and ``$USERPROFILE`` to the temporary directory during test runs.

  This ensures to not load configuration files from the real user&#39;s home directory.


- `4980 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4980&gt;`_: Namespace packages are handled better with ``monkeypatch.syspath_prepend`` and ``testdir.syspathinsert`` (via ``pkg_resources.fixup_namespace_packages``).


- `4993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4993&gt;`_: The stepwise plugin reports status information now.


- `5008 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5008&gt;`_: If a ``setup.cfg`` file contains ``[tool:pytest]`` and also the no longer supported ``[pytest]`` section, pytest will use ``[tool:pytest]`` ignoring ``[pytest]``. Previously it would unconditionally error out.

  This makes it simpler for plugins to support old pytest versions.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1895 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1895&gt;`_: Fix bug where fixtures requested dynamically via ``request.getfixturevalue()`` might be teardown
  before the requesting fixture.


- `4851 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4851&gt;`_: pytester unsets ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS`` now to not use outer options with ``testdir.runpytest()``.


- `4903 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4903&gt;`_: Use the correct modified time for years after 2038 in rewritten ``.pyc`` files.


- `4928 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4928&gt;`_: Fix line offsets with ``ScopeMismatch`` errors.


- `4957 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4957&gt;`_: ``-p no:plugin`` is handled correctly for default (internal) plugins now, e.g. with ``-p no:capture``.

  Previously they were loaded (imported) always, making e.g. the ``capfd`` fixture available.


- `4968 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4968&gt;`_: The pdb ``quit`` command is handled properly when used after the ``debug`` command with `pdb++`_.

  .. _pdb++: https://pypi.org/project/pdbpp/


- `4975 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4975&gt;`_: Fix the interpretation of ``-qq`` option where it was being considered as ``-v`` instead.


- `4978 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4978&gt;`_: ``outcomes.Exit`` is not swallowed in ``assertrepr_compare`` anymore.


- `4988 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4988&gt;`_: Close logging&#39;s file handler explicitly when the session finishes.


- `5003 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5003&gt;`_: Fix line offset with mark collection error (off by one).



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `4974 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4974&gt;`_: Update docs for ``pytest_cmdline_parse`` hook to note availability liminations



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `4718 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4718&gt;`_: ``pluggy&gt;=0.9`` is now required.


- `4815 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4815&gt;`_: ``funcsigs&gt;=1.0`` is now required for Python 2.7.


- `4829 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4829&gt;`_: Some left-over internal code related to ``yield`` tests has been removed.


- `4890 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4890&gt;`_: Remove internally unused ``anypython`` fixture from the pytester plugin.


- `4912 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4912&gt;`_: Remove deprecated Sphinx directive, ``add_description_unit()``,
  pin sphinx-removed-in to &gt;= 0.2.0 to support Sphinx 2.0.


- `4913 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4913&gt;`_: Fix pytest tests invocation with custom ``PYTHONPATH``.


- `4965 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4965&gt;`_: New ``pytest_report_to_serializable`` and ``pytest_report_from_serializable`` **experimental** hooks.

  These hooks will be used by ``pytest-xdist``, ``pytest-subtests``, and the replacement for
  resultlog to serialize and customize reports.

  They are experimental, meaning that their details might change or even be removed
  completely in future patch releases without warning.

  Feedback is welcome from plugin authors and users alike.


- `4987 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4987&gt;`_: ``Collector.repr_failure`` respects the ``--tb`` option, but only defaults to ``short`` now (with ``auto``).

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 4.4.0
   ```
   =========================

Features
--------

- `2224 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2224&gt;`_: ``async`` test functions are skipped and a warning is emitted when a suitable
  async plugin is not installed (such as ``pytest-asyncio`` or ``pytest-trio``).

  Previously ``async`` functions would not execute at all but still be marked as &quot;passed&quot;.


- `2482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2482&gt;`_: Include new ``disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support`` option to disable ascii-escaping in parametrized values. This may cause a series of problems and as the name makes clear, use at your own risk.


- `4718 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4718&gt;`_: The ``-p`` option can now be used to early-load plugins also by entry-point name, instead of just
  by module name.

  This makes it possible to early load external plugins like ``pytest-cov`` in the command-line::

      pytest -p pytest_cov


- `4855 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4855&gt;`_: The ``--pdbcls`` option handles classes via module attributes now (e.g.
  ``pdb:pdb.Pdb`` with `pdb++`_), and its validation was improved.

  .. _pdb++: https://pypi.org/project/pdbpp/


- `4875 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4875&gt;`_: The `testpaths &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.htmlconfval-testpaths&gt;`__ configuration option is now displayed next
  to the ``rootdir`` and ``inifile`` lines in the pytest header if the option is in effect, i.e., directories or file names were
  not explicitly passed in the command line.

  Also, ``inifile`` is only displayed if there&#39;s a configuration file, instead of an empty ``inifile:`` string.


- `4911 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4911&gt;`_: Doctests can be skipped now dynamically using ``pytest.skip()``.


- `4920 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4920&gt;`_: Internal refactorings have been made in order to make the implementation of the
  `pytest-subtests &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-subtests&gt;`__ plugin
  possible, which adds unittest sub-test support and a new ``subtests`` fixture as discussed in
  `1367 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1367&gt;`__.

  For details on the internal refactorings, please see the details on the related PR.


- `4931 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4931&gt;`_: pytester&#39;s ``LineMatcher`` asserts that the passed lines are a sequence.


- `4936 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4936&gt;`_: Handle ``-p plug`` after ``-p no:plug``.

  This can be used to override a blocked plugin (e.g. in &quot;addopts&quot;) from the
  command line etc.


- `4951 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4951&gt;`_: Output capturing is handled correctly when only capturing via fixtures (capsys, capfs) with ``pdb.set_trace()``.


- `4956 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4956&gt;`_: ``pytester`` sets ``$HOME`` and ``$USERPROFILE`` to the temporary directory during test runs.

  This ensures to not load configuration files from the real user&#39;s home directory.


- `4980 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4980&gt;`_: Namespace packages are handled better with ``monkeypatch.syspath_prepend`` and ``testdir.syspathinsert`` (via ``pkg_resources.fixup_namespace_packages``).


- `4993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4993&gt;`_: The stepwise plugin reports status information now.


- `5008 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5008&gt;`_: If a ``setup.cfg`` file contains ``[tool:pytest]`` and also the no longer supported ``[pytest]`` section, pytest will use ``[tool:pytest]`` ignoring ``[pytest]``. Previously it would unconditionally error out.

  This makes it simpler for plugins to support old pytest versions.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1895 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1895&gt;`_: Fix bug where fixtures requested dynamically via ``request.getfixturevalue()`` might be teardown
  before the requesting fixture.


- `4851 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4851&gt;`_: pytester unsets ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS`` now to not use outer options with ``testdir.runpytest()``.


- `4903 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4903&gt;`_: Use the correct modified time for years after 2038 in rewritten ``.pyc`` files.


- `4928 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4928&gt;`_: Fix line offsets with ``ScopeMismatch`` errors.


- `4957 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4957&gt;`_: ``-p no:plugin`` is handled correctly for default (internal) plugins now, e.g. with ``-p no:capture``.

  Previously they were loaded (imported) always, making e.g. the ``capfd`` fixture available.


- `4968 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4968&gt;`_: The pdb ``quit`` command is handled properly when used after the ``debug`` command with `pdb++`_.

  `pytest-subtests &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-subtests&gt;`__ plugin
  possible, which adds unittest sub-test support and a new ``subtests`` fixture as discussed in
  `1367 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1367&gt;`__.

  For details on the internal refactorings, please see the details on the related PR.


- `4931 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4931&gt;`_: pytester&#39;s ``LineMatcher`` asserts that the passed lines are a sequence.


- `4936 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4936&gt;`_: Handle ``-p plug`` after ``-p no:plug``.

  This can be used to override a blocked plugin (e.g. in &quot;addopts&quot;) from the
  command line etc.


- `4951 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4951&gt;`_: Output capturing is handled correctly when only capturing via fixtures (capsys, capfs) with ``pdb.set_trace()``.


- `4956 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4956&gt;`_: ``pytester`` sets ``$HOME`` and ``$USERPROFILE`` to the temporary directory during test runs.

  This ensures to not load configuration files from the real user&#39;s home directory.


- `4980 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4980&gt;`_: Namespace packages are handled better with ``monkeypatch.syspath_prepend`` and ``testdir.syspathinsert`` (via ``pkg_resources.fixup_namespace_packages``).


- `4993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4993&gt;`_: The stepwise plugin reports status information now.


- `5008 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5008&gt;`_: If a ``setup.cfg`` file contains ``[tool:pytest]`` and also the no longer supported ``[pytest]`` section, pytest will use ``[tool:pytest]`` ignoring ``[pytest]``. Previously it would unconditionally error out.

  This makes it simpler for plugins to support old pytest versions.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `1895 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1895&gt;`_: Fix bug where fixtures requested dynamically via ``request.getfixturevalue()`` might be teardown
  before the requesting fixture.


- `4851 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4851&gt;`_: pytester unsets ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS`` now to not use outer options with ``testdir.runpytest()``.


- `4903 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4903&gt;`_: Use the correct modified time for years after 2038 in rewritten ``.pyc`` files.


- `4928 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4928&gt;`_: Fix line offsets with ``ScopeMismatch`` errors.


- `4957 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4957&gt;`_: ``-p no:plugin`` is handled correctly for default (internal) plugins now, e.g. with ``-p no:capture``.

  Previously they were loaded (imported) always, making e.g. the ``capfd`` fixture available.


- `4968 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4968&gt;`_: The pdb ``quit`` command is handled properly when used after the ``debug`` command with `pdb++`_.

  .. _pdb++: https://pypi.org/project/pdbpp/


- `4975 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4975&gt;`_: Fix the interpretation of ``-qq`` option where it was being considered as ``-v`` instead.


- `4978 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4978&gt;`_: ``outcomes.Exit`` is not swallowed in ``assertrepr_compare`` anymore.


- `4988 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4988&gt;`_: Close logging&#39;s file handler explicitly when the session finishes.


- `5003 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5003&gt;`_: Fix line offset with mark collection error (off by one).



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `4974 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4974&gt;`_: Update docs for ``pytest_cmdline_parse`` hook to note availability liminations



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `4718 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4718&gt;`_: ``pluggy&gt;=0.9`` is now required.


- `4815 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4815&gt;`_: ``funcsigs&gt;=1.0`` is now required for Python 2.7.


- `4829 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4829&gt;`_: Some left-over internal code related to ``yield`` tests has been removed.


- `4890 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4890&gt;`_: Remove internally unused ``anypython`` fixture from the pytester plugin.


- `4912 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4912&gt;`_: Remove deprecated Sphinx directive, ``add_description_unit()``,
  pin sphinx-removed-in to &gt;= 0.2.0 to support Sphinx 2.0.


- `4913 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4913&gt;`_: Fix pytest tests invocation with custom ``PYTHONPATH``.


- `4965 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4965&gt;`_: New ``pytest_report_to_serializable`` and ``pytest_report_from_serializable`` **experimental** hooks.

  These hooks will be used by ``pytest-xdist``, ``pytest-subtests``, and the replacement for
  resultlog to serialize and customize reports.

  They are experimental, meaning that their details might change or even be removed
  completely in future patch releases without warning.

  Feedback is welcome from plugin authors and users alike.


- `4987 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4987&gt;`_: ``Collector.repr_failure`` respects the ``--tb`` option, but only defaults to ``short`` now (with ``auto``).

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 4.4.0
   ```
   =========================

Features
--------

- `2224 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2224&gt;`_: ``async`` test functions are skipped and a warning is emitted when a suitable
  async plugin is not installed (such as ``pytest-asyncio`` or ``pytest-trio``).

  Previously ``async`` functions would not execute at all but still be marked as &quot;passed&quot;.


- `2482 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2482&gt;`_: Include new ``disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support`` option to disable ascii-escaping in parametrized values. This may cause a series of problems and as the name makes clear, use at your own risk.


- `4718 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4718&gt;`_: The ``-p`` option can now be used to early-load plugins also by entry-point name, instead of just
  by module name.

  This makes it possible to early load external plugins like ``pytest-cov`` in the command-line::

      pytest -p pytest_cov


- `4855 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4855&gt;`_: The ``--pdbcls`` option handles classes via module attributes now (e.g.
  ``pdb:pdb.Pdb`` with `pdb++`_), and its validation was improved.

  .. _pdb++: https://pypi.org/project/pdbpp/


- `4875 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4875&gt;`_: The `testpaths &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.htmlconfval-testpaths&gt;`__ configuration option is now displayed next
  to the ``rootdir`` and ``inifile`` lines in the pytest header if the option is in effect, i.e., directories or file names were
  not explicitly passed in the command line.

  Also, ``inifile`` is only displayed if there&#39;s a configuration file, instead of an empty ``inifile:`` string.


- `4911 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4911&gt;`_: Doctests can be skipped now dynamically using ``pytest.skip()``.


- `4920 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4920&gt;`_: Internal refactorings have been made in order to make the implementation of the
  `pytest-subtests &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-subtests&gt;`__ plugin

  `1367 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1367&gt;`__.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 4.3.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations
------------

- `4724 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4724&gt;`_: ``pytest.warns()`` now emits a warning when it receives unknown keyword arguments.

  This will be changed into an error in the future.



Features
--------

- `2753 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2753&gt;`_: Usage errors from argparse are mapped to pytest&#39;s ``UsageError``.


- `3711 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3711&gt;`_: Add the ``--ignore-glob`` parameter to exclude test-modules with Unix shell-style wildcards.
  Add the ``collect_ignore_glob`` for ``conftest.py`` to exclude test-modules with Unix shell-style wildcards.


- `4698 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4698&gt;`_: The warning about Python 2.7 and 3.4 not being supported in pytest 5.0 has been removed.

  In the end it was considered to be more
  of a nuisance than actual utility and users of those Python versions shouldn&#39;t have problems as ``pip`` will not
  install pytest 5.0 on those interpreters.


- `4707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4707&gt;`_: With the help of new ``set_log_path()`` method there is a way to set ``log_file`` paths from hooks.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4651 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4651&gt;`_: ``--help`` and ``--version`` are handled with ``UsageError``.


- `4782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4782&gt;`_: Fix ``AssertionError`` with collection of broken symlinks with packages.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2895 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2895&gt;`_: The ``pytest_report_collectionfinish`` hook now is also called with ``--collect-only``.


- `3899 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3899&gt;`_: Do not raise ``UsageError`` when an imported package has a ``pytest_plugins.py`` child module.


- `4347 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4347&gt;`_: Fix output capturing when using pdb++ with recursive debugging.


- `4592 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4592&gt;`_: Fix handling of ``collect_ignore`` via parent ``conftest.py``.


- `4700 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4700&gt;`_: Fix regression where ``setUpClass`` would always be called in subclasses even if all tests
  were skipped by a ``unittest.skip()`` decorator applied in the subclass.


- `4739 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4739&gt;`_: Fix ``parametrize(... ids=&lt;function&gt;)`` when the function returns non-strings.


- `4745 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4745&gt;`_: Fix/improve collection of args when passing in ``__init__.py`` and a test file.


- `4770 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4770&gt;`_: ``more_itertools`` is now constrained to &lt;6.0.0 when required for Python 2.7 compatibility.


- `526 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/526&gt;`_: Fix &quot;ValueError: Plugin already registered&quot; exceptions when running in build directories that symlink to actual source.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `3899 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3899&gt;`_: Add note to ``plugins.rst`` that ``pytest_plugins`` should not be used as a name for a user module containing plugins.


- `4324 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4324&gt;`_: Document how to use ``raises`` and ``does_not_raise`` to write parametrized tests with conditional raises.


- `4709 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4709&gt;`_: Document how to customize test failure messages when using
  ``pytest.warns``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `4741 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4741&gt;`_: Some verbosity related attributes of the TerminalReporter plugin are now
  read only properties.

Deprecations
------------

- `4724 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4724&gt;`_: ``pytest.warns()`` now emits a warning when it receives unknown keyword arguments.

  This will be changed into an error in the future.



Features
--------

- `2753 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2753&gt;`_: Usage errors from argparse are mapped to pytest&#39;s ``UsageError``.


- `3711 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3711&gt;`_: Add the ``--ignore-glob`` parameter to exclude test-modules with Unix shell-style wildcards.
  Add the ``collect_ignore_glob`` for ``conftest.py`` to exclude test-modules with Unix shell-style wildcards.


- `4698 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4698&gt;`_: The warning about Python 2.7 and 3.4 not being supported in pytest 5.0 has been removed.

  In the end it was considered to be more
  of a nuisance than actual utility and users of those Python versions shouldn&#39;t have problems as ``pip`` will not
  install pytest 5.0 on those interpreters.


- `4707 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4707&gt;`_: With the help of new ``set_log_path()`` method there is a way to set ``log_file`` paths from hooks.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `4651 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4651&gt;`_: ``--help`` and ``--version`` are handled with ``UsageError``.


- `4782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4782&gt;`_: Fix ``AssertionError`` with collection of broken symlinks with packages.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.2.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `2895 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2895&gt;`_: The ``pytest_report_collectionfinish`` hook now is also called with ``--collect-only``.


- `3899 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3899&gt;`_: Do not raise ``UsageError`` when an imported package has a ``pytest_plugins.py`` child module.


- `4347 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4347&gt;`_: Fix output capturing when using pdb++ with recursive debugging.


- `4592 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4592&gt;`_: Fix handling of ``collect_ignore`` via parent ``conftest.py``.


- `4700 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4700&gt;`_: Fix regression where ``setUpClass`` would always be called in subclasses even if all tests
  were skipped by a ``unittest.skip()`` decorator applied in the subclass.


- `4739 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4739&gt;`_: Fix ``parametrize(... ids=&lt;function&gt;)`` when the function returns non-strings.


- `4745 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4745&gt;`_: Fix/improve collection of args when passing in ``__init__.py`` and a test file.


- `4770 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4770&gt;`_: ``more_itertools`` is now constrained to &lt;6.0.0 when required for Python 2.7 compatibility.


- `526 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/526&gt;`_: Fix &quot;ValueError: Plugin already registered&quot; exceptions when running in build directories that symlink to actual source.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `3899 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3899&gt;`_: Add note to ``plugins.rst`` that ``pytest_plugins`` should not be used as a name for a user module containing plugins.


- `4324 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4324&gt;`_: Document how to use ``raises`` and ``does_not_raise`` to write parametrized tests with conditional raises.


- `4709 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4709&gt;`_: Document how to customize test failure messages when using
  ``pytest.warns``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `4741 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4741&gt;`_: Some verbosity related attributes of the TerminalReporter plugin are now
  read only properties.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.1.1** to **4.2.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 4.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Features
--------

- `3094 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3094&gt;`_: `Class xunit-style &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/xunit_setup.html&gt;`__ functions and methods
  now obey the scope of *autouse* fixtures.

  This fixes a number of surprising issues like ``setup_method`` being called before session-scoped
  autouse fixtures (see `517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/517&gt;`__ for an example).


- `4627 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4627&gt;`_: Display a message at the end of the test session when running under Python 2.7 and 3.4 that pytest 5.0 will no longer
  support those Python versions.


- `4660 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4660&gt;`_: The number of *selected* tests now are also displayed when the ``-k`` or ``-m`` flags are used.


- `4688 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4688&gt;`_: ``pytest_report_teststatus`` hook now can also receive a ``config`` parameter.


- `4691 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4691&gt;`_: ``pytest_terminal_summary`` hook now can also receive a ``config`` parameter.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `3547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3547&gt;`_: ``--junitxml`` can emit XML compatible with Jenkins xUnit.
  ``junit_family`` INI option accepts ``legacy|xunit1``, which produces old style output, and ``xunit2`` that conforms more strictly to https://github.com/jenkinsci/xunit-plugin/blob/xunit-2.3.2/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/xunit/types/model/xsd/junit-10.xsd


- `4280 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4280&gt;`_: Improve quitting from pdb, especially with ``--trace``.

  Using ``q[quit]`` after ``pdb.set_trace()`` will quit pytest also.


- `4402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4402&gt;`_: Warning summary now groups warnings by message instead of by test id.

  This makes the output more compact and better conveys the general idea of how much code is
  actually generating warnings, instead of how many tests call that code.


- `4536 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4536&gt;`_: ``monkeypatch.delattr`` handles class descriptors like ``staticmethod``/``classmethod``.


- `4649 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4649&gt;`_: Restore marks being considered keywords for keyword expressions.


- `4653 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4653&gt;`_: ``tmp_path`` fixture and other related ones provides resolved path (a.k.a real path)


- `4667 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4667&gt;`_: ``pytest_terminal_summary`` uses result from ``pytest_report_teststatus`` hook, rather than hardcoded strings.


- `4669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4669&gt;`_: Correctly handle ``unittest.SkipTest`` exception containing non-ascii characters on Python 2.


- `4680 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4680&gt;`_: Ensure the ``tmpdir`` and the ``tmp_path`` fixtures are the same folder.


- `4681 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4681&gt;`_: Ensure ``tmp_path`` is always a real path.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `4643 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4643&gt;`_: Use ``a.item()`` instead of the deprecated ``np.asscalar(a)`` in ``pytest.approx``.

  ``np.asscalar`` has been `deprecated &lt;https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/release/1.16.0-notes.rstnew-deprecations&gt;`__ in ``numpy 1.16.``.


- `4657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4657&gt;`_: Copy saferepr from pylib
   ```

   ### 4.2.0
   ```
   =========================

Features
--------

- `3094 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3094&gt;`_: `Class xunit-style &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/xunit_setup.html&gt;`__ functions and methods
  now obey the scope of *autouse* fixtures.

  This fixes a number of surprising issues like ``setup_method`` being called before session-scoped
  autouse fixtures (see `517 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/517&gt;`__ for an example).


- `4627 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4627&gt;`_: Display a message at the end of the test session when running under Python 2.7 and 3.4 that pytest 5.0 will no longer
  support those Python versions.


- `4660 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4660&gt;`_: The number of *selected* tests now are also displayed when the ``-k`` or ``-m`` flags are used.


- `4688 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4688&gt;`_: ``pytest_report_teststatus`` hook now can also receive a ``config`` parameter.


- `4691 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4691&gt;`_: ``pytest_terminal_summary`` hook now can also receive a ``config`` parameter.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `3547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3547&gt;`_: ``--junitxml`` can emit XML compatible with Jenkins xUnit.
  ``junit_family`` INI option accepts ``legacy|xunit1``, which produces old style output, and ``xunit2`` that conforms more strictly to https://github.com/jenkinsci/xunit-plugin/blob/xunit-2.3.2/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/xunit/types/model/xsd/junit-10.xsd


- `4280 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4280&gt;`_: Improve quitting from pdb, especially with ``--trace``.

  Using ``q[quit]`` after ``pdb.set_trace()`` will quit pytest also.


- `4402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4402&gt;`_: Warning summary now groups warnings by message instead of by test id.

  This makes the output more compact and better conveys the general idea of how much code is
  actually generating warnings, instead of how many tests call that code.


- `4536 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4536&gt;`_: ``monkeypatch.delattr`` handles class descriptors like ``staticmethod``/``classmethod``.


- `4649 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4649&gt;`_: Restore marks being considered keywords for keyword expressions.


- `4653 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4653&gt;`_: ``tmp_path`` fixture and other related ones provides resolved path (a.k.a real path)


- `4667 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4667&gt;`_: ``pytest_terminal_summary`` uses result from ``pytest_report_teststatus`` hook, rather than hardcoded strings.


- `4669 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4669&gt;`_: Correctly handle ``unittest.SkipTest`` exception containing non-ascii characters on Python 2.


- `4680 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4680&gt;`_: Ensure the ``tmpdir`` and the ``tmp_path`` fixtures are the same folder.


- `4681 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4681&gt;`_: Ensure ``tmp_path`` is always a real path.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `4643 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4643&gt;`_: Use ``a.item()`` instead of the deprecated ``np.asscalar(a)`` in ``pytest.approx``.

  ``np.asscalar`` has been `deprecated &lt;https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/release/1.16.0-notes.rstnew-deprecations&gt;`__ in ``numpy 1.16.``.


- `4657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4657&gt;`_: Copy saferepr from pylib
   ```

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **4.0.2** to **4.1.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 4.1.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `2169 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2169&gt;`_: ``pytest.mark.parametrize``: in previous versions, errors raised by id functions were suppressed and changed into warnings. Now the exceptions are propagated, along with a pytest message informing the node, parameter value and index where the exception occurred.


- `3078 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3078&gt;`_: Remove legacy internal warnings system: ``config.warn``, ``Node.warn``. The ``pytest_logwarning`` now issues a warning when implemented.

  See our `docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlconfig-warn-and-node-warn&gt;`__ on information on how to update your code.


- `3079 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3079&gt;`_: Removed support for yield tests - they are fundamentally broken because they don&#39;t support fixtures properly since collection and test execution were separated.

  See our `docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlyield-tests&gt;`__ on information on how to update your code.


- `3082 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3082&gt;`_: Removed support for applying marks directly to values in ``pytest.mark.parametrize``. Use ``pytest.param`` instead.

  See our `docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlmarks-in-pytest-mark-parametrize&gt;`__ on information on how to update your code.


- `3083 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3083&gt;`_: Removed ``Metafunc.addcall``. This was the predecessor mechanism to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.

  See our `docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlmetafunc-addcall&gt;`__ on information on how to update your code.


- `3085 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3085&gt;`_: Removed support for passing strings to ``pytest.main``. Now, always pass a list of strings instead.

  See our `docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlpassing-command-line-string-to-pytest-main&gt;`__ on information on how to update your code.


- `3086 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3086&gt;`_: ``[pytest]`` section in **setup.cfg** files is not longer supported, use ``[tool:pytest]`` instead. ``setup.cfg`` files
  are meant for use with ``distutils``, and a section named ``pytest`` has notoriously been a source of conflicts and bugs.

  Note that for **pytest.ini** and **tox.ini** files the section remains ``[pytest]``.


- `3616 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3616&gt;`_: Removed the deprecated compat properties for ``node.Class/Function/Module`` - use ``pytest.Class/Function/Module`` now.

  See our `docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlinternal-classes-accessed-through-node&gt;`__ on information on how to update your code.


- `4421 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4421&gt;`_: Removed the implementation of the ``pytest_namespace`` hook.

  See our `docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlpytest-namespace&gt;`__ on information on how to update your code.


- `4489 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4489&gt;`_: Removed ``request.cached_setup``. This was the predecessor mechanism to modern fixtures.

  See our `docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlcached-setup&gt;`__ on information on how to update your code.


- `4535 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4535&gt;`_: Removed the deprecated ``PyCollector.makeitem`` method. This method was made public by mistake a long time ago.


- `4543 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4543&gt;`_: Removed support to define fixtures using the ``pytest_funcarg__`` prefix. Use the ``pytest.fixture`` decorator instead.

  See our `docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlpytest-funcarg-prefix&gt;`__ on information on how to update your code.


- `4545 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4545&gt;`_: Calling fixtures directly is now always an error instead of a warning.

  See our `docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlcalling-fixtures-directly&gt;`__ on information on how to update your code.


- `4546 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4546&gt;`_: Remove ``Node.get_marker(name)`` the return value was not usable for more than a existence check.

  Use ``Node.get_closest_marker(name)`` as a replacement.


- `4547 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4547&gt;`_: The deprecated ``record_xml_property`` fixture has been removed, use the more generic ``record_property`` instead.

  See our `docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlrecord-xml-property&gt;`__ for more information.


- `4548 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4548&gt;`_: An error is now raised if the ``pytest_plugins`` variable is defined in a non-top-level ``conftest.py`` file (i.e., not residing in the ``rootdir``).

  See our `docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlpytest-plugins-in-non-top-level-conftest-files&gt;`__ for more information.


- `891 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/891&gt;`_: Remove ``testfunction.markername`` attributes - use ``Node.iter_markers(name=None)`` to iterate them.



Deprecations
------------

- `3050 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3050&gt;`_: Deprecated the ``pytest.config`` global.

  See https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlpytest-config-global for rationale.


- `3974 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3974&gt;`_: Passing the ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises`` now issues a ``DeprecationWarning``.

  It is a common mistake to think this parameter will match the exception message, while in fact
  it only serves to provide a custom message in case the ``pytest.raises`` check fails. To avoid this
  mistake and because it is believed to be little used, pytest is deprecating it without providing
  an alternative for the moment.

  If you have concerns about this, please comment on `issue 3974 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3974&gt;`__.


- `4435 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4435&gt;`_: Deprecated ``raises(..., &#39;code(as_a_string)&#39;)`` and ``warns(..., &#39;code(as_a_string)&#39;)``.

  See https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlraises-warns-exec for rationale and examples.



Features
--------

- `3191 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3191&gt;`_: A warning is now issued when assertions are made for ``None``.

  This is a common source of confusion among new users, which write:

  .. code-block:: python

      assert mocked_object.assert_called_with(3, 4, 5, key=&quot;value&quot;)

  When they should write:

  .. code-block:: python

      mocked_object.assert_called_with(3, 4, 5, key=&quot;value&quot;)

  Because the ``assert_called_with`` method of mock objects already executes an assertion.

  This warning will not be issued when ``None`` is explicitly checked. An assertion like:

  .. code-block:: python

      assert variable is None

  will not issue the warning.


- `3632 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3632&gt;`_: Richer equality comparison introspection on ``AssertionError`` for objects created using `attrs &lt;http://www.attrs.org/en/stable/&gt;`__ or `dataclasses &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html&gt;`_ (Python 3.7+, `backported to 3.6 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/dataclasses&gt;`__).


- `4278 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4278&gt;`_: ``CACHEDIR.TAG`` files are now created inside cache directories.

  Those files are part of the `Cache Directory Tagging Standard &lt;http://www.bford.info/cachedir/spec.html&gt;`__, and can
  be used by backup or synchronization programs to identify pytest&#39;s cache directory as such.


- `4292 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4292&gt;`_: ``pytest.outcomes.Exit`` is derived from ``SystemExit`` instead of ``KeyboardInterrupt``. This allows us to better handle ``pdb`` exiting.


- `4371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4371&gt;`_: Updated the ``--collect-only`` option to display test descriptions when ran using ``--verbose``.


- `4386 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4386&gt;`_: Restructured ``ExceptionInfo`` object construction and ensure incomplete instances have a ``repr``/``str``.


- `4416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4416&gt;`_: pdb: added support for keyword arguments with ``pdb.set_trace``.

  It handles ``header`` similar to Python 3.7 does it, and forwards any
  other keyword arguments to the ``Pdb`` constructor.

  This allows for ``__import__(&quot;pdb&quot;).set_trace(skip=[&quot;foo.*&quot;])``.


- `4483 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4483&gt;`_: Added ini parameter ``junit_duration_report`` to optionally report test call durations, excluding setup and teardown times.

  The JUnit XML specification and the default pytest behavior is to include setup and teardown times in the test duration
  report. You can include just the call durations instead (excluding setup and teardown) by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      junit_duration_report = call


- `4532 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4532&gt;`_: ``-ra`` now will show errors and failures last, instead of as the first items in the summary.

  This makes it easier to obtain a list of errors and failures to run tests selectively.


- `4599 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4599&gt;`_: ``pytest.importorskip`` now supports a ``reason`` parameter, which will be shown when the
  requested module cannot be imported.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `3532 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3532&gt;`_: ``-p`` now accepts its argument without a space between the value, for example ``-pmyplugin``.


- `4327 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4327&gt;`_: ``approx`` again works with more generic containers, more precisely instances of ``Iterable`` and ``Sized`` instead of more restrictive ``Sequence``.


- `4397 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4397&gt;`_: Ensure that node ids are printable.


- `4435 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4435&gt;`_: Fixed ``raises(..., &#39;code(string)&#39;)`` frame filename.


- `4458 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4458&gt;`_: Display actual test ids in ``--collect-only``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `4557 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4557&gt;`_: Markers example documentation page updated to support latest pytest version.


- `4558 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4558&gt;`_: Update cache documentation example to correctly show cache hit and miss.


- `4580 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4580&gt;`_: Improved detailed summary report documentation.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `4447 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4447&gt;`_: Changed the deprecation type of ``--result-log`` to ``PytestDeprecationWarning``.

  It was decided to remove this feature at the next major revision.

- `891 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/891&gt;`_: Remove ``testfunction.markername`` attributes - use ``Node.iter_markers(name=None)`` to iterate them.



Deprecations
------------

- `3050 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3050&gt;`_: Deprecated the ``pytest.config`` global.

  See https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlpytest-config-global for rationale.


- `3974 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3974&gt;`_: Passing the ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises`` now issues a ``DeprecationWarning``.

  It is a common mistake to think this parameter will match the exception message, while in fact
  it only serves to provide a custom message in case the ``pytest.raises`` check fails. To avoid this
  mistake and because it is believed to be little used, pytest is deprecating it without providing
  an alternative for the moment.

  If you have concerns about this, please comment on `issue 3974 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3974&gt;`__.


- `4435 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4435&gt;`_: Deprecated ``raises(..., &#39;code(as_a_string)&#39;)`` and ``warns(..., &#39;code(as_a_string)&#39;)``.

  See https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlraises-warns-exec for rationale and examples.



Features
--------

- `3191 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3191&gt;`_: A warning is now issued when assertions are made for ``None``.

  This is a common source of confusion among new users, which write:

  .. code-block:: python

      assert mocked_object.assert_called_with(3, 4, 5, key=&quot;value&quot;)

  When they should write:

  .. code-block:: python

      mocked_object.assert_called_with(3, 4, 5, key=&quot;value&quot;)

  Because the ``assert_called_with`` method of mock objects already executes an assertion.

  This warning will not be issued when ``None`` is explicitly checked. An assertion like:

  .. code-block:: python

      assert variable is None

  will not issue the warning.


- `3632 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3632&gt;`_: Richer equality comparison introspection on ``AssertionError`` for objects created using `attrs &lt;http://www.attrs.org/en/stable/&gt;`__ or `dataclasses &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html&gt;`_ (Python 3.7+, `backported to 3.6 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/dataclasses&gt;`__).


- `4278 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4278&gt;`_: ``CACHEDIR.TAG`` files are now created inside cache directories.

  Those files are part of the `Cache Directory Tagging Standard &lt;http://www.bford.info/cachedir/spec.html&gt;`__, and can
  be used by backup or synchronization programs to identify pytest&#39;s cache directory as such.


- `4292 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4292&gt;`_: ``pytest.outcomes.Exit`` is derived from ``SystemExit`` instead of ``KeyboardInterrupt``. This allows us to better handle ``pdb`` exiting.


- `4371 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4371&gt;`_: Updated the ``--collect-only`` option to display test descriptions when ran using ``--verbose``.


- `4386 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4386&gt;`_: Restructured ``ExceptionInfo`` object construction and ensure incomplete instances have a ``repr``/``str``.


- `4416 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4416&gt;`_: pdb: added support for keyword arguments with ``pdb.set_trace``.

  It handles ``header`` similar to Python 3.7 does it, and forwards any
  other keyword arguments to the ``Pdb`` constructor.

  This allows for ``__import__(&quot;pdb&quot;).set_trace(skip=[&quot;foo.*&quot;])``.


- `4483 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4483&gt;`_: Added ini parameter ``junit_duration_report`` to optionally report test call durations, excluding setup and teardown times.

  The JUnit XML specification and the default pytest behavior is to include setup and teardown times in the test duration
  report. You can include just the call durations instead (excluding setup and teardown) by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      junit_duration_report = call


- `4532 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4532&gt;`_: ``-ra`` now will show errors and failures last, instead of as the first items in the summary.

  This makes it easier to obtain a list of errors and failures to run tests selectively.


- `4599 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4599&gt;`_: ``pytest.importorskip`` now supports a ``reason`` parameter, which will be shown when the
  requested module cannot be imported.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `3532 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3532&gt;`_: ``-p`` now accepts its argument without a space between the value, for example ``-pmyplugin``.


- `4327 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4327&gt;`_: ``approx`` again works with more generic containers, more precisely instances of ``Iterable`` and ``Sized`` instead of more restrictive ``Sequence``.


- `4397 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4397&gt;`_: Ensure that node ids are printable.


- `4435 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4435&gt;`_: Fixed ``raises(..., &#39;code(string)&#39;)`` frame filename.


- `4458 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4458&gt;`_: Display actual test ids in ``--collect-only``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `4557 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4557&gt;`_: Markers example documentation page updated to support latest pytest version.


- `4558 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4558&gt;`_: Update cache documentation example to correctly show cache hit and miss.


- `4580 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4580&gt;`_: Improved detailed summary report documentation.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `4447 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4447&gt;`_: Changed the deprecation type of ``--result-log`` to ``PytestDeprecationWarning``.

  It was decided to remove this feature at the next major revision.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **3.10.0** to **4.0.0**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 4.0.0
   ```
   =========================

Removals
--------

- `3737 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3737&gt;`_: **RemovedInPytest4Warnings are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``RemovedInPytest4Warnings`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 4.1**, so please consult the
  `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`__
  section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``4.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.RemovedInPytest4Warning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``4.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to `4348 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4348&gt;`__.


- `4358 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4358&gt;`_: Remove the ``::()`` notation to denote a test class instance in node ids.

  Previously, node ids that contain test instances would use ``::()`` to denote the instance like this::

      test_foo.py::Test::()::test_bar

  The extra ``::()`` was puzzling to most users and has been removed, so that the test id becomes now::

      test_foo.py::Test::test_bar

  This change could not accompany a deprecation period as is usual when user-facing functionality changes because
  it was not really possible to detect when the functionality was being used explicitly.

  The extra ``::()`` might have been removed in some places internally already,
  which then led to confusion in places where it was expected, e.g. with
  ``--deselect`` (`4127 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4127&gt;`_).

  Test class instances are also not listed with ``--collect-only`` anymore.



Features
--------

- `4270 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4270&gt;`_: The ``cache_dir`` option uses ``$TOX_ENV_DIR`` as prefix (if set in the environment).

  This uses a different cache per tox environment by default.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `3554 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3554&gt;`_: Fix ``CallInfo.__repr__`` for when the call is not finished yet.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.10.1
   ```
   ==========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `4287 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4287&gt;`_: Fix nested usage of debugging plugin (pdb), e.g. with pytester&#39;s ``testdir.runpytest``.


- `4304 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4304&gt;`_: Block the ``stepwise`` plugin if ``cacheprovider`` is also blocked, as one depends on the other.


- `4306 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4306&gt;`_: Parse ``minversion`` as an actual version and not as dot-separated strings.


- `4310 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4310&gt;`_: Fix duplicate collection due to multiple args matching the same packages.


- `4321 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4321&gt;`_: Fix ``item.nodeid`` with resolved symlinks.


- `4325 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4325&gt;`_: Fix collection of direct symlinked files, where the target does not match ``python_files``.


- `4329 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4329&gt;`_: Fix TypeError in report_collect with _collect_report_last_write.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `4305 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4305&gt;`_: Replace byte/unicode helpers in test_capture with python level syntax.

  should not be overwritten as it will lead to internal errors.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `4255 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4255&gt;`_: Added missing documentation about the fact that module names passed to filter warnings are not regex-escaped.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `4272 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4272&gt;`_: Display cachedir also in non-verbose mode if non-default.

  Do not display &quot;IO-capturing turned off/on&quot; when ``-s`` is used to avoid
  confusion.


- `4279 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4279&gt;`_: Improve message and stack level of warnings issued by ``monkeypatch.setenv`` when the value of the environment variable is not a ``str``.

- `4159 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4159&gt;`_: For test-suites containing test classes, the information about the subclassed
  module is now output only if a higher verbosity level is specified (at least
  &quot;-vv&quot;).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.9.0
   ```
   =========================================================================

Deprecations
------------

- `3616 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3616&gt;`_: The following accesses have been documented as deprecated for years, but are now actually emitting deprecation warnings.

  * Access of ``Module``, ``Function``, ``Class``, ``Instance``, ``File`` and ``Item`` through ``Node`` instances. Now
    users will this warning::

          usage of Function.Module is deprecated, please use pytest.Module instead

    Users should just ``import pytest`` and access those objects using the ``pytest`` module.

  * ``request.cached_setup``, this was the precursor of the setup/teardown mechanism available to fixtures. You can
    consult `funcarg comparison section in the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/funcarg_compare.html&gt;`_.

  * Using objects named ``&quot;Class&quot;`` as a way to customize the type of nodes that are collected in ``Collector``
    subclasses has been deprecated. Users instead should use ``pytest_collect_make_item`` to customize node types during
    collection.

    This issue should affect only advanced plugins who create new collection types, so if you see this warning
    message please contact the authors so they can change the code.

  * The warning that produces the message below has changed to ``RemovedInPytest4Warning``::

          getfuncargvalue is deprecated, use getfixturevalue


- `3988 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3988&gt;`_: Add a Deprecation warning for pytest.ensuretemp as it was deprecated since a while.



Features
--------

- `2293 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2293&gt;`_: Improve usage errors messages by hiding internal details which can be distracting and noisy.

  This has the side effect that some error conditions that previously raised generic errors (such as
  ``ValueError`` for unregistered marks) are now raising ``Failed`` exceptions.


- `3332 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3332&gt;`_: Improve the error displayed when a ``conftest.py`` file could not be imported.

  In order to implement this, a new ``chain`` parameter was added to ``ExceptionInfo.getrepr``
  to show or hide chained tracebacks in Python 3 (defaults to ``True``).


- `3849 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3849&gt;`_: Add ``empty_parameter_set_mark=fail_at_collect`` ini option for raising an exception when parametrize collects an empty set.


- `3964 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3964&gt;`_: Log messages generated in the collection phase are shown when
  live-logging is enabled and/or when they are logged to a file.


- `3985 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3985&gt;`_: Introduce ``tmp_path`` as a fixture providing a Path object.


- `4013 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4013&gt;`_: Deprecation warnings are now shown even if you customize the warnings filters yourself. In the previous version
  any customization would override pytest&#39;s filters and deprecation warnings would fall back to being hidden by default.


- `4073 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4073&gt;`_: Allow specification of timeout for ``Testdir.runpytest_subprocess()`` and ``Testdir.run()``.


- `4098 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4098&gt;`_: Add returncode argument to pytest.exit() to exit pytest with a specific return code.


- `4102 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4102&gt;`_: Reimplement ``pytest.deprecated_call`` using ``pytest.warns`` so it supports the ``match=&#39;...&#39;`` keyword argument.

  This has the side effect that ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now raises ``pytest.fail.Exception`` instead
  of ``AssertionError``.


- `4149 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4149&gt;`_: Require setuptools&gt;=30.3 and move most of the metadata to ``setup.cfg``.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `2535 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2535&gt;`_: Improve error message when test functions of ``unittest.TestCase`` subclasses use a parametrized fixture.


- `3057 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3057&gt;`_: ``request.fixturenames`` now correctly returns the name of fixtures created by ``request.getfixturevalue()``.


- `3946 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3946&gt;`_: Warning filters passed as command line options using ``-W`` now take precedence over filters defined in ``ini``
  configuration files.


- `4066 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4066&gt;`_: Fix source reindenting by using ``textwrap.dedent`` directly.


- `4102 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4102&gt;`_: ``pytest.warn`` will capture previously-warned warnings in Python 2. Previously they were never raised.


- `4108 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4108&gt;`_: Resolve symbolic links for args.

  This fixes running ``pytest tests/test_foo.py::test_bar``, where ``tests``
  is a symlink to ``project/app/tests``:
  previously ``project/app/conftest.py`` would be ignored for fixtures then.


- `4132 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4132&gt;`_: Fix duplicate printing of internal errors when using ``--pdb``.


- `4135 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4135&gt;`_: pathlib based tmpdir cleanup now correctly handles symlinks in the folder.


- `4152 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4152&gt;`_: Display the filename when encountering ``SyntaxWarning``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `3713 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3713&gt;`_: Update usefixtures documentation to clarify that it can&#39;t be used with fixture functions.


- `4058 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4058&gt;`_: Update fixture documentation to specify that a fixture can be invoked twice in the scope it&#39;s defined for.


- `4064 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4064&gt;`_: According to unittest.rst, setUpModule and tearDownModule were not implemented, but it turns out they are. So updated the documentation for unittest.


- `4151 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4151&gt;`_: Add tempir testing example to CONTRIBUTING.rst guide



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `2293 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2293&gt;`_: The internal ``MarkerError`` exception has been removed.


- `3988 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3988&gt;`_: Port the implementation of tmpdir to pathlib.


- `4063 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4063&gt;`_: Exclude 0.00 second entries from ``--duration`` output unless ``-vv`` is passed on the command-line.


- `4093 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4093&gt;`_: Fixed formatting of string literals in internal tests.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.8.2
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- `4036 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4036&gt;`_: The ``item`` parameter of ``pytest_warning_captured`` hook is now documented as deprecated. We realized only after
  the ``3.8`` release that this parameter is incompatible with ``pytest-xdist``.

  Our policy is to not deprecate features during bugfix releases, but in this case we believe it makes sense as we are
  only documenting it as deprecated, without issuing warnings which might potentially break test suites. This will get
  the word out that hook implementers should not use this parameter at all.

  In a future release ``item`` will always be ``None`` and will emit a proper warning when a hook implementation
  makes use of it.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `3539 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3539&gt;`_: Fix reload on assertion rewritten modules.


- `4034 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4034&gt;`_: The ``.user_properties`` attribute of ``TestReport`` objects is a list
  of (name, value) tuples, but could sometimes be instantiated as a tuple
  of tuples.  It is now always a list.


- `4039 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4039&gt;`_: No longer issue warnings about using ``pytest_plugins`` in non-top-level directories when using ``--pyargs``: the
  current ``--pyargs`` mechanism is not reliable and might give false negatives.


- `4040 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4040&gt;`_: Exclude empty reports for passed tests when ``-rP`` option is used.


- `4051 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4051&gt;`_: Improve error message when an invalid Python expression is passed to the ``-m`` option.


- `4056 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4056&gt;`_: ``MonkeyPatch.setenv`` and ``MonkeyPatch.delenv`` issue a warning if the environment variable name is not ``str`` on Python 2.

  In Python 2, adding ``unicode`` keys to ``os.environ`` causes problems with ``subprocess`` (and possible other modules),
  making this a subtle bug specially susceptible when used with ``from __future__ import unicode_literals``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `3928 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3928&gt;`_: Add possible values for fixture scope to docs.

    non-git repos&quot; when the git binary is not installed.
  * Note that commit info can still be set with env vars, even in non-git
    repositories -- see the docs for more info!

 Compatibility
* **python:**  include python 3.7 in matrix tests ([023d474](023d474))
  * previous versions of `coveralls-python` should be compatible with Python 3.7, no
    code changes were required to make tests pass

 Internal
* remove `pytest-runner` as a dependency (185) ([4cbbfcd](4cbbfcd))

   ### 3.8.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `3286 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3286&gt;`_: ``.pytest_cache`` directory is now automatically ignored by Git. Users who would like to contribute a solution for other SCMs please consult/comment on this issue.


- `3749 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3749&gt;`_: Fix the following error during collection of tests inside packages::

      TypeError: object of type &#39;Package&#39; has no len()


- `3941 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3941&gt;`_: Fix bug where indirect parametrization would consider the scope of all fixtures used by the test function to determine the parametrization scope, and not only the scope of the fixtures being parametrized.


- `3973 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3973&gt;`_: Fix crash of the assertion rewriter if a test changed the current working directory without restoring it afterwards.


- `3998 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3998&gt;`_: Fix issue that prevented some caplog properties (for example ``record_tuples``) from being available when entering the debugger with ``--pdb``.


- `3999 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3999&gt;`_: Fix ``UnicodeDecodeError`` in python2.x when a class returns a non-ascii binary ``__repr__`` in an assertion which also contains non-ascii text.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `3996 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3996&gt;`_: New `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`_ page shows all currently
  deprecated features, the rationale to do so, and alternatives to update your code. It also list features removed
  from pytest in past major releases to help those with ancient pytest versions to upgrade.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `3955 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3955&gt;`_: Improve pre-commit detection for changelog filenames


- `3975 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3975&gt;`_: Remove legacy code around im_func as that was python2 only

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.7.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- `2639 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2639&gt;`_: ``pytest_namespace`` has been deprecated.

  See the documentation for ``pytest_namespace`` hook for suggestions on how to deal
  with this in plugins which use this functionality.


- `3661 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3661&gt;`_: Calling a fixture function directly, as opposed to request them in a test function, now issues a ``RemovedInPytest4Warning``. It will be changed into an error in pytest ``4.0``.

  This is a great source of confusion to new users, which will often call the fixture functions and request them from test functions interchangeably, which breaks the fixture resolution model.



Features
--------

- `2283 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2283&gt;`_: New ``package`` fixture scope: fixtures are finalized when the last test of a *package* finishes. This feature is considered **experimental**, so use it sparingly.


- `3576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3576&gt;`_: ``Node.add_marker`` now supports an ``append=True/False`` parameter to determine whether the mark comes last (default) or first.


- `3579 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3579&gt;`_: Fixture ``caplog`` now has a ``messages`` property, providing convenient access to the format-interpolated log messages without the extra data provided by the formatter/handler.


- `3610 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3610&gt;`_: New ``--trace`` option to enter the debugger at the start of a test.


- `3623 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3623&gt;`_: Introduce ``pytester.copy_example`` as helper to do acceptance tests against examples from the project.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `2220 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2220&gt;`_: Fix a bug where fixtures overridden by direct parameters (for example parametrization) were being instantiated even if they were not being used by a test.


- `3695 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3695&gt;`_: Fix ``ApproxNumpy`` initialisation argument mixup, ``abs`` and ``rel`` tolerances were flipped causing strange comparsion results.
  Add tests to check ``abs`` and ``rel`` tolerances for ``np.array`` and test for expecting ``nan`` with ``np.array()``


- `980 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/980&gt;`_: Fix truncated locals output in verbose mode.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `3295 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3295&gt;`_: Correct the usage documentation of ``--last-failed-no-failures`` by adding the missing ``--last-failed`` argument in the presented examples, because they are misleading and lead to think that the missing argument is not needed.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `3519 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3519&gt;`_: Now a ``README.md`` file is created in ``.pytest_cache`` to make it clear why the directory exists.

   ### 3.6.0
   ```
   =========================

Features
--------

- Revamp the internals of the ``pytest.mark`` implementation with correct per
  node handling which fixes a number of long standing bugs caused by the old
  design. This introduces new ``Node.iter_markers(name)`` and
  ``Node.get_closest_mark(name)`` APIs. Users are **strongly encouraged** to
  read the `reasons for the revamp in the docs
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.htmlmarker-revamp-and-iteration&gt;`_,
  or jump over to details about `updating existing code to use the new APIs
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.htmlupdating-code&gt;`_. (`3317
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3317&gt;`_)

- Now when ``pytest.fixture`` is applied more than once to the same function a
  ``ValueError`` is raised. This buggy behavior would cause surprising problems
  and if was working for a test suite it was mostly by accident. (`2334
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2334&gt;`_)

- Support for Python 3.7&#39;s builtin ``breakpoint()`` method, see `Using the
  builtin breakpoint function
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlbreakpoint-builtin&gt;`_ for
  details. (`3180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3180&gt;`_)

- ``monkeypatch`` now supports a ``context()`` function which acts as a context
  manager which undoes all patching done within the ``with`` block. (`3290
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3290&gt;`_)

- The ``--pdb`` option now causes KeyboardInterrupt to enter the debugger,
  instead of stopping the test session. On python 2.7, hitting CTRL+C again
  exits the debugger. On python 3.2 and higher, use CTRL+D. (`3299
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3299&gt;`_)

- pytest not longer changes the log level of the root logger when the
  ``log-level`` parameter has greater numeric value than that of the level of
  the root logger, which makes it play better with custom logging configuration
  in user code. (`3307 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3307&gt;`_)


Bug Fixes
---------

- A rare race-condition which might result in corrupted ``.pyc`` files on
  Windows has been hopefully solved. (`3008
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3008&gt;`_)

- Also use iter_marker for discovering the marks applying for marker
  expressions from the cli to avoid the bad data from the legacy mark storage.
  (`3441 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3441&gt;`_)

- When showing diffs of failed assertions where the contents contain only
  whitespace, escape them using ``repr()`` first to make it easy to spot the
  differences. (`3443 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3443&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Change documentation copyright year to a range which auto-updates itself each
  time it is published. (`3303
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3303&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- ``pytest`` now depends on the `python-atomicwrites
  &lt;https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites&gt;`_ library. (`3008
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3008&gt;`_)

- Update all pypi.python.org URLs to pypi.org. (`3431
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3431&gt;`_)

- Detect `pytest_` prefixed hooks using the internal plugin manager since
  ``pluggy`` is deprecating the ``implprefix`` argument to ``PluginManager``.
  (`3487 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3487&gt;`_)

- Import ``Mapping`` and ``Sequence`` from ``_pytest.compat`` instead of
  directly from ``collections`` in ``python_api.py::approx``. Add ``Mapping``
  to ``_pytest.compat``, import it from ``collections`` on python 2, but from
  ``collections.abc`` on Python 3 to avoid a ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python
  3.7 or newer. (`3497 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3497&gt;`_)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.5.1
   ```
   =========================


Bug Fixes
---------

- Reset ``sys.last_type``, ``sys.last_value`` and ``sys.last_traceback`` before
  each test executes. Those attributes are added by pytest during the test run
  to aid debugging, but were never reset so they would create a leaking
  reference to the last failing test&#39;s frame which in turn could never be
  reclaimed by the garbage collector. (`2798
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2798&gt;`_)

- ``pytest.raises`` now raises ``TypeError`` when receiving an unknown keyword
  argument. (`3348 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3348&gt;`_)

- ``pytest.raises`` now works with exception classes that look like iterables.
  (`3372 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3372&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Fix typo in ``caplog`` fixture documentation, which incorrectly identified
  certain attributes as methods. (`3406
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3406&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Added a more indicative error message when parametrizing a function whose
  argument takes a default value. (`3221
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3221&gt;`_)

- Remove internal ``_pytest.terminal.flatten`` function in favor of
  ``more_itertools.collapse``. (`3330
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3330&gt;`_)

- Import some modules from ``collections.abc`` instead of ``collections`` as
  the former modules trigger ``DeprecationWarning`` in Python 3.7. (`3339
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3339&gt;`_)

- record_property is no longer experimental, removing the warnings was
  forgotten. (`3360 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3360&gt;`_)

- Mention in documentation and CLI help that fixtures with leading ``_`` are
  printed by ``pytest --fixtures`` only if the ``-v`` option is added. (`3398
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3398&gt;`_)

- Fix reference cycle generated when using the ``request`` fixture. (`3249
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3249&gt;`_)

- ``[tool:pytest]`` sections in ``*.cfg`` files passed by the ``-c`` option are
  now properly recognized. (`3260
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3260&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add logging plugin to plugins list. (`3209
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3209&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Fix minor typo in fixture.rst (`3259
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3259&gt;`_)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.4.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Move import of ``doctest.UnexpectedException`` to top-level to avoid possible
  errors when using ``--pdb``. (`1810
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1810&gt;`_)

- Added printing of captured stdout/stderr before entering pdb, and improved a
  test which was giving false negatives about output capturing. (`3052
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3052&gt;`_)

- Fix ordering of tests using parametrized fixtures which can lead to fixtures
  being created more than necessary. (`3161
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3161&gt;`_)

- Fix bug where logging happening at hooks outside of &quot;test run&quot; hooks would
  cause an internal error. (`3184
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3184&gt;`_)

- Detect arguments injected by ``unittest.mock.patch`` decorator correctly when
  pypi ``mock.patch`` is installed and imported. (`3206
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3206&gt;`_)

- Errors shown when a ``pytest.raises()`` with ``match=`` fails are now cleaner
  on what happened: When no exception was raised, the &quot;matching &#39;...&#39;&quot; part got
  removed as it falsely implies that an exception was raised but it didn&#39;t
  match. When a wrong exception was raised, it&#39;s now thrown (like
  ``pytest.raised()`` without ``match=`` would) instead of complaining about
  the unmatched text. (`3222
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3222&gt;`_)

- Fixed output capture handling in doctests on macOS. (`985
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/985&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add Sphinx parameter docs for ``match`` and ``message`` args to
  ``pytest.raises``. (`3202
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3202&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- pytest has changed the publication procedure and is now being published to
  PyPI directly from Travis. (`3060
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3060&gt;`_)

- Rename ``ParameterSet._for_parameterize()`` to ``_for_parametrize()`` in
  order to comply with the naming convention. (`3166
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3166&gt;`_)

- Skip failing pdb/doctest test on mac. (`985
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/985&gt;`_)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.4.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- All pytest classes now subclass ``object`` for better Python 2/3 compatibility.
  This should not affect user code except in very rare edge cases. (`2147
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147&gt;`_)


Features
--------

- Introduce ``empty_parameter_set_mark`` ini option to select which mark to
  apply when ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` is given an empty set of parameters.
  Valid options are ``skip`` (default) and ``xfail``. Note that it is planned
  to change the default to ``xfail`` in future releases as this is considered
  less error prone. (`2527
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2527&gt;`_)

- **Incompatible change**: after community feedback the `logging
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_ functionality has
  undergone some changes. Please consult the `logging documentation
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.htmlincompatible-changes-in-pytest-3-4&gt;`_
  for details. (`3013 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3013&gt;`_)

- Console output falls back to &quot;classic&quot; mode when capturing is disabled (``-s``),
  otherwise the output gets garbled to the point of being useless. (`3038
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3038&gt;`_)

- New `pytest_runtest_logfinish
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_logfinish&gt;`_
  hook which is called when a test item has finished executing, analogous to
  `pytest_runtest_logstart
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_start&gt;`_.
  (`3101 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3101&gt;`_)

- Improve performance when collecting tests using many fixtures. (`3107
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3107&gt;`_)

- New ``caplog.get_records(when)`` method which provides access to the captured
  records for the ``&quot;setup&quot;``, ``&quot;call&quot;`` and ``&quot;teardown&quot;``
  testing stages. (`3117 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3117&gt;`_)

- New fixture ``record_xml_attribute`` that allows modifying and inserting
  attributes on the ``&lt;testcase&gt;`` xml node in JUnit reports. (`3130
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3130&gt;`_)

- The default cache directory has been renamed from ``.cache`` to
  ``.pytest_cache`` after community feedback that the name ``.cache`` did not
  make it clear that it was used by pytest. (`3138
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3138&gt;`_)

- Colorize the levelname column in the live-log output. (`3142
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3142&gt;`_)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix hanging pexpect test on MacOS by using flush() instead of wait().
  (`2022 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2022&gt;`_)

- Fix restoring Python state after in-process pytest runs with the
  ``pytester`` plugin; this may break tests using multiple inprocess
  pytest runs if later ones depend on earlier ones leaking global interpreter
  changes. (`3016 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3016&gt;`_)

- Fix skipping plugin reporting hook when test aborted before plugin setup
  hook. (`3074 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3074&gt;`_)

- Fix progress percentage reported when tests fail during teardown. (`3088
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3088&gt;`_)

- **Incompatible change**: ``-o/--override`` option no longer eats all the
  remaining options, which can lead to surprising behavior: for example,
  ``pytest -o foo=1 /path/to/test.py`` would fail because ``/path/to/test.py``
  would be considered as part of the ``-o`` command-line argument. One
  consequence of this is that now multiple configuration overrides need
  multiple ``-o`` flags: ``pytest -o foo=1 -o bar=2``. (`3103
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3103&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Document hooks (defined with ``historic=True``) which cannot be used with
  ``hookwrapper=True``. (`2423
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2423&gt;`_)

- Clarify that warning capturing doesn&#39;t change the warning filter by default.
  (`2457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2457&gt;`_)

- Clarify a possible confusion when using pytest_fixture_setup with fixture
  functions that return None. (`2698
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2698&gt;`_)

- Fix the wording of a sentence on doctest flags used in pytest. (`3076
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3076&gt;`_)

- Prefer ``https://*.readthedocs.io`` over ``http://*.rtfd.org`` for links in
  the documentation. (`3092
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3092&gt;`_)

- Improve readability (wording, grammar) of Getting Started guide (`3131
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3131&gt;`_)

- Added note that calling pytest.main multiple times from the same process is
  not recommended because of import caching. (`3143
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3143&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Show a simple and easy error when keyword expressions trigger a syntax error
  (for example, ``&quot;-k foo and import&quot;`` will show an error that you can not use
  the ``import`` keyword in expressions). (`2953
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2953&gt;`_)

- Change parametrized automatic test id generation to use the ``__name__``
  attribute of functions instead of the fallback argument name plus counter.
  (`2976 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2976&gt;`_)

- Replace py.std with stdlib imports. (`3067
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3067&gt;`_)

- Corrected &#39;you&#39; to &#39;your&#39; in logging docs. (`3129
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3129&gt;`_)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.3.2
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- pytester: ignore files used to obtain current user metadata in the fd leak
  detector. (`2784 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2784&gt;`_)

- Fix **memory leak** where objects returned by fixtures were never destructed
  by the garbage collector. (`2981
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2981&gt;`_)

- Fix conversion of pyargs to filename to not convert symlinks on Python 2. (`2985
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2985&gt;`_)

- ``PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE`` is now checked for plugins too rather than only for
  test modules. (`2995 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2995&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add clarifying note about behavior of multiple parametrized arguments (`3001
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3001&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Code cleanup. (`3015 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3015&gt;`_,
  `3021 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3021&gt;`_)

- Clean up code by replacing imports and references of `_ast` to `ast`. (`3018
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3018&gt;`_)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.3.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix issue about ``-p no:&lt;plugin&gt;`` having no effect. (`2920
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2920&gt;`_)

- Fix regression with warnings that contained non-strings in their arguments in
  Python 2. (`2956 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2956&gt;`_)

- Always escape null bytes when setting ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST``. (`2957
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2957&gt;`_)

- Fix ``ZeroDivisionError`` when using the ``testmon`` plugin when no tests
  were actually collected. (`2971
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2971&gt;`_)

- Bring back ``TerminalReporter.writer`` as an alias to
  ``TerminalReporter._tw``. This alias was removed by accident in the ``3.3.0``
  release. (`2984 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2984&gt;`_)

- The ``pytest-capturelog`` plugin is now also blacklisted, avoiding errors when
  running pytest with it still installed. (`3004
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3004&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Fix broken link to plugin ``pytest-localserver``. (`2963
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2963&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Update github &quot;bugs&quot; link in ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` (`2949
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2949&gt;`_)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.3.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions
  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on
  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we
  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users
  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)

- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the
  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2636
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2636&gt;`_)

- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken
  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal
  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)

- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack
  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)

- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it
  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

- The ``params`` list passed to ``pytest.fixture`` is now for
  all effects considered immutable and frozen at the moment of the ``pytest.fixture``
  call. Previously the list could be changed before the first invocation of the fixture
  allowing for a form of dynamic parametrization (for example, updated from command-line options),
  but this was an unwanted implementation detail which complicated the internals and prevented
  some internal cleanup. See issue `2959 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2959&gt;`_
  for details and a recommended workaround.

Features
--------

- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``
  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available
  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and
  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``
  declarations on functions. (`2267
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)

- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)

- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The
  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``
  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)

- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)

- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard ``logging`` module.
  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options
  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using
  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test
  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).
  For more information, please see the `logging docs
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was
  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog
  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch
  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the
  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has
  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)

- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the
  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)

- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)

- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and
  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)

- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from
  ``readouterr()``. (`2923
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2923&gt;`_)

- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from
  ``readouterr()``. (`2934
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2934&gt;`_)

- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with
  ``--doctest-modules``. (`502
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/502&gt;`_)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.
  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)

- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now
  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the
  original traceback. In Python 2 it will show the original traceback with a new
  message that explains in which plugin. In Python 3 it will show 2 canonized
  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an
  exception that pytest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)

- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)

- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to
  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)

- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its
  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``
  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and
  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)

- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being
  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,
  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation
  for safety. (`2809 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2809&gt;`_)

- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from
  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (`2845
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2845&gt;`_)

- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which
  should not be rewritten. (`2939
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2939&gt;`_)

- Handle marks without description in ``pytest.ini``. (`2942
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2942&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- pytest now depends on `attrs &lt;https://pypi.org/project/attrs/&gt;`_ for internal
  structures to ease code maintainability. (`2641
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2641&gt;`_)

- Refactored internal Python 2/3 compatibility code to use ``six``. (`2642
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2642&gt;`_)

- Stop vendoring ``pluggy`` - we&#39;re missing out on its latest changes for not
  much benefit (`2719 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2719&gt;`_)

- Internal refactor: simplify ascii string escaping by using the
  backslashreplace error handler in newer Python 3 versions. (`2734
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2734&gt;`_)

- Remove unnecessary mark evaluator in unittest plugin (`2767
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

- Calls to ``Metafunc.addcall`` now emit a deprecation warning. This function
  is scheduled to be removed in ``pytest-4.0``. (`2876
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2876&gt;`_)

- Internal move of the parameterset extraction to a more maintainable place.
  (`2877 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2877&gt;`_)

- Internal refactoring to simplify scope node lookup. (`2910
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2910&gt;`_)

- Configure ``pytest`` to prevent pip from installing pytest in unsupported
  Python versions. (`2922
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2922&gt;`_)

>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Add Sphinx parameter docs for ``match`` and ``message`` args to
>  ``pytest.raises``. (`3202
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3202&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- pytest has changed the publication procedure and is now being published to
>  PyPI directly from Travis. (`3060
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3060&gt;`_)

>- Rename ``ParameterSet._for_parameterize()`` to ``_for_parametrize()`` in
>  order to comply with the naming convention. (`3166
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3166&gt;`_)

>- Skip failing pdb/doctest test on mac. (`985
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/985&gt;`_)




>### 3.4.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- All pytest classes now subclass ``object`` for better Python 2/3 compatibility.
>  This should not affect user code except in very rare edge cases. (`2147
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147&gt;`_)


>Features
>--------

>- Introduce ``empty_parameter_set_mark`` ini option to select which mark to
>  apply when ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` is given an empty set of parameters.
>  Valid options are ``skip`` (default) and ``xfail``. Note that it is planned
>  to change the default to ``xfail`` in future releases as this is considered
>  less error prone. (`2527
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2527&gt;`_)

>- **Incompatible change**: after community feedback the `logging
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_ functionality has
>  undergone some changes. Please consult the `logging documentation
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.htmlincompatible-changes-in-pytest-3-4&gt;`_
>  for details. (`3013 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3013&gt;`_)

>- Console output falls back to &quot;classic&quot; mode when capturing is disabled (``-s``),
>  otherwise the output gets garbled to the point of being useless. (`3038
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3038&gt;`_)

>- New `pytest_runtest_logfinish
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_logfinish&gt;`_
>  hook which is called when a test item has finished executing, analogous to
>  `pytest_runtest_logstart
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_start&gt;`_.
>  (`3101 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3101&gt;`_)

>- Improve performance when collecting tests using many fixtures. (`3107
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3107&gt;`_)

>- New ``caplog.get_records(when)`` method which provides access to the captured
>  records for the ``&quot;setup&quot;``, ``&quot;call&quot;`` and ``&quot;teardown&quot;``
>  testing stages. (`3117 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3117&gt;`_)

>- New fixture ``record_xml_attribute`` that allows modifying and inserting
>  attributes on the ``&lt;testcase&gt;`` xml node in JUnit reports. (`3130
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3130&gt;`_)

>- The default cache directory has been renamed from ``.cache`` to
>  ``.pytest_cache`` after community feedback that the name ``.cache`` did not
>  make it clear that it was used by pytest. (`3138
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3138&gt;`_)

>- Colorize the levelname column in the live-log output. (`3142
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3142&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix hanging pexpect test on MacOS by using flush() instead of wait().
>  (`2022 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2022&gt;`_)

>- Fix restoring Python state after in-process pytest runs with the
>  ``pytester`` plugin; this may break tests using multiple inprocess
>  pytest runs if later ones depend on earlier ones leaking global interpreter
>  changes. (`3016 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3016&gt;`_)

>- Fix skipping plugin reporting hook when test aborted before plugin setup
>  hook. (`3074 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3074&gt;`_)

>- Fix progress percentage reported when tests fail during teardown. (`3088
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3088&gt;`_)

>- **Incompatible change**: ``-o/--override`` option no longer eats all the
>  remaining options, which can lead to surprising behavior: for example,
>  ``pytest -o foo=1 /path/to/test.py`` would fail because ``/path/to/test.py``
>  would be considered as part of the ``-o`` command-line argument. One
>  consequence of this is that now multiple configuration overrides need
>  multiple ``-o`` flags: ``pytest -o foo=1 -o bar=2``. (`3103
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3103&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Document hooks (defined with ``historic=True``) which cannot be used with
>  ``hookwrapper=True``. (`2423
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2423&gt;`_)

>- Clarify that warning capturing doesn&#39;t change the warning filter by default.
>  (`2457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2457&gt;`_)

>- Clarify a possible confusion when using pytest_fixture_setup with fixture
>  functions that return None. (`2698
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2698&gt;`_)

>- Fix the wording of a sentence on doctest flags used in pytest. (`3076
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3076&gt;`_)

>- Prefer ``https://*.readthedocs.io`` over ``http://*.rtfd.org`` for links in
>  the documentation. (`3092
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3092&gt;`_)

>- Improve readability (wording, grammar) of Getting Started guide (`3131
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3131&gt;`_)

>- Added note that calling pytest.main multiple times from the same process is
>  not recommended because of import caching. (`3143
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3143&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Show a simple and easy error when keyword expressions trigger a syntax error
>  (for example, ``&quot;-k foo and import&quot;`` will show an error that you can not use
>  the ``import`` keyword in expressions). (`2953
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2953&gt;`_)

>- Change parametrized automatic test id generation to use the ``__name__``
>  attribute of functions instead of the fallback argument name plus counter.
>  (`2976 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2976&gt;`_)

>- Replace py.std with stdlib imports. (`3067
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3067&gt;`_)

>- Corrected &#39;you&#39; to &#39;your&#39; in logging docs. (`3129
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3129&gt;`_)




>### 3.3.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytester: ignore files used to obtain current user metadata in the fd leak
>  detector. (`2784 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2784&gt;`_)

>- Fix **memory leak** where objects returned by fixtures were never destructed
>  by the garbage collector. (`2981
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2981&gt;`_)

>- Fix conversion of pyargs to filename to not convert symlinks on Python 2. (`2985
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2985&gt;`_)

>- ``PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE`` is now checked for plugins too rather than only for
>  test modules. (`2995 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2995&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Add clarifying note about behavior of multiple parametrized arguments (`3001
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3001&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Code cleanup. (`3015 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3015&gt;`_,
>  `3021 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3021&gt;`_)

>- Clean up code by replacing imports and references of `_ast` to `ast`. (`3018
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3018&gt;`_)




>### 3.3.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix issue about ``-p no:&lt;plugin&gt;`` having no effect. (`2920
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2920&gt;`_)

>- Fix regression with warnings that contained non-strings in their arguments in
>  Python 2. (`2956 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2956&gt;`_)

>- Always escape null bytes when setting ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST``. (`2957
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2957&gt;`_)

>- Fix ``ZeroDivisionError`` when using the ``testmon`` plugin when no tests
>  were actually collected. (`2971
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2971&gt;`_)

>- Bring back ``TerminalReporter.writer`` as an alias to
>  ``TerminalReporter._tw``. This alias was removed by accident in the ``3.3.0``
>  release. (`2984 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2984&gt;`_)

>- The ``pytest-capturelog`` plugin is now also blacklisted, avoiding errors when
>  running pytest with it still installed. (`3004
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3004&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Fix broken link to plugin ``pytest-localserver``. (`2963
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2963&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Update github &quot;bugs&quot; link in ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` (`2949
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2949&gt;`_)




>### 3.3.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions
>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on
>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we
>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users
>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)

>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the
>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2636
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2636&gt;`_)

>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken
>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal
>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)

>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack
>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)

>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it
>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>- The ``params`` list passed to ``pytest.fixture`` is now for
>  all effects considered immutable and frozen at the moment of the ``pytest.fixture``
>  call. Previously the list could be changed before the first invocation of the fixture
>  allowing for a form of dynamic parametrization (for example, updated from command-line options),
>  but this was an unwanted implementation detail which complicated the internals and prevented
>  some internal cleanup. See issue `2959 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2959&gt;`_
>  for details and a recommended workaround.

>Features
>--------

>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``
>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available
>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and
>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``
>  declarations on functions. (`2267
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)

>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)

>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The
>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``
>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)

>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)

>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.
>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options
>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using
>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test
>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).
>  For more information, please see the `logging docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was
>  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog
>  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch
>  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the
>  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has
>  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)

>- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the
>  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)

>- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)

>- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and
>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2923
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2923&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2934
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2934&gt;`_)

>- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with
>  ``--doctest-modules``. (`502
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/502&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.
>  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)

>- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now
>  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the
>  original traceback. In Python 2 it will show the original traceback with a new
>  message that explains in which plugin. In Python 3 it will show 2 canonized
>  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an
>  exception that pytest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)

>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)

>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to
>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)

>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its
>  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``
>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and
>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)

>- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being
>  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,
>  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation
>  for safety. (`2809 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2809&gt;`_)

>- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from
>  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (`2845
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2845&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which
>  should not be rewritten. (`2939
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2939&gt;`_)

>- Handle marks without description in ``pytest.ini``. (`2942
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2942&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- pytest now depends on `attrs &lt;https://pypi.org/project/attrs/&gt;`_ for internal
>  structures to ease code maintainability. (`2641
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2641&gt;`_)

>- Refactored internal Python 2/3 compatibility code to use ``six``. (`2642
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2642&gt;`_)

>- Stop vendoring ``pluggy`` - we&#39;re missing out on its latest changes for not
>  much benefit (`2719 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2719&gt;`_)

>- Internal refactor: simplify ascii string escaping by using the
>  backslashreplace error handler in newer Python 3 versions. (`2734
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2734&gt;`_)

>- Remove unnecessary mark evaluator in unittest plugin (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>- Calls to ``Metafunc.addcall`` now emit a deprecation warning. This function
>  is scheduled to be removed in ``pytest-4.0``. (`2876
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2876&gt;`_)

>- Internal move of the parameterset extraction to a more maintainable place.
>  (`2877 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2877&gt;`_)

>- Internal refactoring to simplify scope node lookup. (`2910
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2910&gt;`_)

>- Configure ``pytest`` to prevent pip from installing pytest in unsupported
>  Python versions. (`2922

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.4.1

>=========================

>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1810&gt;`_)

>- Added printing of captured stdout/stderr before entering pdb, and improved a
>  test which was giving false negatives about output capturing. (`3052
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3052&gt;`_)

>- Fix ordering of tests using parametrized fixtures which can lead to fixtures
>  being created more than necessary. (`3161
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3161&gt;`_)

>- Fix bug where logging happening at hooks outside of &quot;test run&quot; hooks would
>  cause an internal error. (`3184
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3184&gt;`_)

>- Detect arguments injected by ``unittest.mock.patch`` decorator correctly when

>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2971&gt;`_)

>  release. (`2984 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2984&gt;`_)

>- Update github &quot;bugs&quot; link in ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` (`2949
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2949&gt;`_)




>### 3.3.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions
>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on
>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we
>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users
>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)

>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the
>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2636
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2636&gt;`_)

>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken
>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal
>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)

>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack
>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)

>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it
>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>- The ``params`` list passed to ``pytest.fixture`` is now for
>  all effects considered immutable and frozen at the moment of the ``pytest.fixture``
>  call. Previously the list could be changed before the first invocation of the fixture
>  allowing for a form of dynamic parametrization (for example, updated from command-line options),
>  but this was an unwanted implementation detail which complicated the internals and prevented
>  some internal cleanup. See issue `2959 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2959&gt;`_
>  for details and a recommended workaround.

>Features
>--------

>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``
>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available
>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and
>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``
>  declarations on functions. (`2267
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)

>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)

>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The
>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``
>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)

>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)

>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.
>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options
>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using
>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test
>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).
>  For more information, please see the `logging docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was
>  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog
>  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch
>  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the
>  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has
>  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)

>- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the
>  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)

>- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)

>- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and
>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2923
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2923&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2934
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2934&gt;`_)

>- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with
>  ``--doctest-modules``. (`502
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/502&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.
>  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)

>- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now
>  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the
>  original traceback. In Python 2 it will show the original traceback with a new
>  message that explains in which plugin. In Python 3 it will show 2 canonized
>  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an
>  exception that pytest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)

>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)

>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to
>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)

>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its
>  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``
>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and
>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)

>- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being
>  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,
>  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation
>  for safety. (`2809 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2809&gt;`_)

>- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from
>  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (`2845
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2845&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which
>  should not be rewritten. (`2939
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2939&gt;`_)

>- Handle marks without description in ``pytest.ini``. (`2942
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2942&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- pytest now depends on `attrs &lt;https://pypi.org/project/attrs/&gt;`_ for internal
>  structures to ease code maintainability. (`2641
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2641&gt;`_)

>- Refactored internal Python 2/3 compatibility code to use ``six``. (`2642
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2642&gt;`_)

>- Stop vendoring ``pluggy`` - we&#39;re missing out on its latest changes for not
>  much benefit (`2719 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2719&gt;`_)

>- Internal refactor: simplify ascii string escaping by using the
>  backslashreplace error handler in newer Python 3 versions. (`2734
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2734&gt;`_)

>- Remove unnecessary mark evaluator in unittest plugin (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>- Calls to ``Metafunc.addcall`` now emit a deprecation warning. This function
>  is scheduled to be removed in ``pytest-4.0``. (`2876
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2876&gt;`_)

>- Internal move of the parameterset extraction to a more maintainable place.
>  (`2877 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2877&gt;`_)

>- Internal refactoring to simplify scope node lookup. (`2910
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2910&gt;`_)

>- Configure ``pytest`` to prevent pip from installing pytest in unsupported
>  Python versions. (`2922

>### 3.3.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions
>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on
>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we
>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users
>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)

>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the
>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2636
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2636&gt;`_)

>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken
>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal
>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)

>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack
>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)

>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it
>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>- The ``params`` list passed to ``pytest.fixture`` is now for
>  all effects considered immutable and frozen at the moment of the ``pytest.fixture``
>  call. Previously the list could be changed before the first invocation of the fixture
>  allowing for a form of dynamic parametrization (for example, updated from command-line options),

>  some internal cleanup. See issue `2959 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2959&gt;`_
>  for details and a recommended workaround.

>Features
>--------

>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``
>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available
>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and
>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``
>  declarations on functions. (`2267
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)

>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)

>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The
>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``
>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)

>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)

>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.
>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options
>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using
>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test
>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).
>  For more information, please see the `logging docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was

>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from

>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)

>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709

>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to
>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)

>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its

>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and
>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)

>- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.3.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix issue about ``-p no:&lt;plugin&gt;`` having no effect. (`2920
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2920&gt;`_)

>- Fix regression with warnings that contained non-strings in their arguments in
>  Python 2. (`2956 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2956&gt;`_)

>- Always escape null bytes when setting ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST``. (`2957
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2957&gt;`_)

>- Fix ``ZeroDivisionError`` when using the ``testmon`` plugin when no tests
>  were actually collected. (`2971
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2971&gt;`_)

>- Bring back ``TerminalReporter.writer`` as an alias to
>  ``TerminalReporter._tw``. This alias was removed by accident in the ``3.3.0``
>  release. (`2984 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2984&gt;`_)

>- The ``pytest-capturelog`` plugin is now also blacklisted, avoiding errors when
>  running pytest with it still installed. (`3004
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3004&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Fix broken link to plugin ``pytest-localserver``. (`2963
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2963&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Update github &quot;bugs&quot; link in ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` (`2949
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2949&gt;`_)




>### 3.3.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions
>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on
>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we
>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users
>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)

>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the
>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2636
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2636&gt;`_)

>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken
>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal
>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)

>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack
>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)

>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it
>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>- The ``params`` list passed to ``pytest.fixture`` is now for
>  all effects considered immutable and frozen at the moment of the ``pytest.fixture``
>  call. Previously the list could be changed before the first invocation of the fixture
>  allowing for a form of dynamic parametrization (for example, updated from command-line options),
>  but this was an unwanted implementation detail which complicated the internals and prevented
>  some internal cleanup. See issue `2959 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2959&gt;`_
>  for details and a recommended workaround.

>Features
>--------

>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``
>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available
>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and
>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``
>  declarations on functions. (`2267
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)

>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)

>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The
>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``
>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)

>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)

>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.
>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options
>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using
>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test
>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).
>  For more information, please see the `logging docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was
>  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog
>  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch
>  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the
>  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has
>  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)

>- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the
>  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)

>- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)

>- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and
>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2923
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2923&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2934
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2934&gt;`_)

>- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with
>  ``--doctest-modules``. (`502
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/502&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.
>  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)

>- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now
>  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the
>  original traceback. In python2 it will show the original traceback with a new
>  message that explains in which plugin. In python3 it will show 2 canonized
>  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an
>  exception that PyTest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)

>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)

>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to
>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)

>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its
>  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``
>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and
>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)

>- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being
>  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,
>  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation
>  for safety. (`2809 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2809&gt;`_)

>- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from
>  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (`2845
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2845&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which

### pytest 3.0.5 -> 3.2.2

>### 3.2.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Calling the deprecated `request.getfuncargvalue()` now shows the source of
>  the call. (`2681 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2681&gt;`_)

>- Allow tests declared as ``staticmethod`` to use fixtures. (`2699
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2699&gt;`_)

>- Fixed edge-case during collection: attributes which raised ``pytest.fail``
>  when accessed would abort the entire collection. (`2707
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2707&gt;`_)

>- Fix ``ReprFuncArgs`` with mixed unicode and UTF-8 args. (`2731
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2731&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- In examples on working with custom markers, add examples demonstrating the
>  usage of ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.with_args`` in comparison with
>  ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.__call__`` (`2604
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2604&gt;`_)

>- In one of the simple examples, use `pytest_collection_modifyitems()` to skip
>  tests based on a command-line option, allowing its sharing while preventing a
>  user error when acessing `pytest.config` before the argument parsing. (`2653
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2653&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Fixed minor error in &#39;Good Practices/Manual Integration&#39; code snippet.
>  (`2691 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2691&gt;`_)

>- Fixed typo in goodpractices.rst. (`2721
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2721&gt;`_)

>- Improve user guidance regarding ``--resultlog`` deprecation. (`2739
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2739&gt;`_)




>### 3.2.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fixed small terminal glitch when collecting a single test item. (`2579
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2579&gt;`_)

>- Correctly consider ``/`` as the file separator to automatically mark plugin
>  files for rewrite on Windows. (`2591 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2591&gt;`_)

>- Properly escape test names when setting ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment
>  variable. (`2644 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2644&gt;`_)

>- Fix error on Windows and Python 3.6+ when ``sys.stdout`` has been replaced
>  with a stream-like object which does not implement the full ``io`` module
>  buffer protocol. In particular this affects ``pytest-xdist`` users on the
>  aforementioned platform. (`2666 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2666&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly document which pytest features work with ``unittest``. (`2626
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2626&gt;`_)




>### 3.2.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- ``pytest.approx`` no longer supports ``&gt;``, ``&gt;=``, ``&lt;`` and ``&lt;=``
>  operators to avoid surprising/inconsistent behavior. See `the docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/builtin.htmlpytest.approx&gt;`_ for more
>  information. (`2003 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2003&gt;`_)

>- All old-style specific behavior in current classes in the pytest&#39;s API is
>  considered deprecated at this point and will be removed in a future release.
>  This affects Python 2 users only and in rare situations. (`2147
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147&gt;`_)

>- A deprecation warning is now raised when using marks for parameters
>  in ``pytest.mark.parametrize``. Use ``pytest.param`` to apply marks to
>  parameters instead. (`2427 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2427&gt;`_)


>Features
>--------

>- Add support for numpy arrays (and dicts) to approx. (`1994
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1994&gt;`_)

>- Now test function objects have a ``pytestmark`` attribute containing a list
>  of marks applied directly to the test function, as opposed to marks inherited
>  from parent classes or modules. (`2516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2516&gt;`_)

>- Collection ignores local virtualenvs by default; `--collect-in-virtualenv`
>  overrides this behavior. (`2518 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2518&gt;`_)

>- Allow class methods decorated as ``staticmethod`` to be candidates for
>  collection as a test function. (Only for Python 2.7 and above. Python 2.6
>  will still ignore static methods.) (`2528 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2528&gt;`_)

>- Introduce ``mark.with_args`` in order to allow passing functions/classes as
>  sole argument to marks. (`2540 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2540&gt;`_)

>- New ``cache_dir`` ini option: sets the directory where the contents of the
>  cache plugin are stored. Directory may be relative or absolute path: if relative path, then
>  directory is created relative to ``rootdir``, otherwise it is used as is.
>  Additionally path may contain environment variables which are expanded during
>  runtime. (`2543 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2543&gt;`_)

>- Introduce the ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment variable that is set with
>  the ``nodeid`` and stage (``setup``, ``call`` and ``teardown``) of the test
>  being currently executed. See the `documentation
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.htmlpytest-current-test-
>  environment-variable&gt;`_ for more info. (`2583 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2583&gt;`_)

>- Introduced ``pytest.mark.filterwarnings`` mark which allows overwriting the
>  warnings filter on a per test, class or module level. See the `docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.htmlpytest-mark-
>  filterwarnings&gt;`_ for more information. (`2598 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2598&gt;`_)

>- ``--last-failed`` now remembers forever when a test has failed and only
>  forgets it if it passes again. This makes it easy to fix a test suite by
>  selectively running files and fixing tests incrementally. (`2621
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2621&gt;`_)

>- New ``pytest_report_collectionfinish`` hook which allows plugins to add
>  messages to the terminal reporting after collection has been finished
>  successfully. (`2622 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2622&gt;`_)

>- Added support for `PEP-415&#39;s &lt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0415/&gt;`_
>  ``Exception.__suppress_context__``. Now if a ``raise exception from None`` is
>  caught by pytest, pytest will no longer chain the context in the test report.
>  The behavior now matches Python&#39;s traceback behavior. (`2631
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2631&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised by ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.skip`` and ``pytest.xfail``
>  now subclass BaseException, making them harder to be caught unintentionally
>  by normal code. (`580 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/580&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Set ``stdin`` to a closed ``PIPE`` in ``pytester.py.Testdir.popen()`` for
>  avoid unwanted interactive ``pdb`` (`2023 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2023&gt;`_)

>- Add missing ``encoding`` attribute to ``sys.std*`` streams when using
>  ``capsys`` capture mode. (`2375 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2375&gt;`_)

>- Fix terminal color changing to black on Windows if ``colorama`` is imported
>  in a ``conftest.py`` file. (`2510 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2510&gt;`_)

>- Fix line number when reporting summary of skipped tests. (`2548
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2548&gt;`_)

>- capture: ensure that EncodedFile.name is a string. (`2555
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2555&gt;`_)

>- The options ``--fixtures`` and ``--fixtures-per-test`` will now keep
>  indentation within docstrings. (`2574 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2574&gt;`_)

>- doctests line numbers are now reported correctly, fixing `pytest-sugar122
>  &lt;https://github.com/Frozenball/pytest-sugar/issues/122&gt;`_. (`2610
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2610&gt;`_)

>- Fix non-determinism in order of fixture collection. Adds new dependency
>  (ordereddict) for Python 2.6. (`920 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/920&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Clarify ``pytest_configure`` hook call order. (`2539
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2539&gt;`_)

>- Extend documentation for testing plugin code with the ``pytester`` plugin.
>  (`971 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/971&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Update help message for ``--strict`` to make it clear it only deals with
>  unregistered markers, not warnings. (`2444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2444&gt;`_)

>- Internal code move: move code for pytest.approx/pytest.raises to own files in
>  order to cut down the size of python.py (`2489 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2489&gt;`_)

>- Renamed the utility function ``_pytest.compat._escape_strings`` to
>  ``_ascii_escaped`` to better communicate the function&#39;s purpose. (`2533
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2533&gt;`_)

>- Improve error message for CollectError with skip/skipif. (`2546
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2546&gt;`_)

>- Emit warning about ``yield`` tests being deprecated only once per generator.
>  (`2562 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2562&gt;`_)

>- Ensure final collected line doesn&#39;t include artifacts of previous write.
>  (`2571 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2571&gt;`_)

>- Fixed all flake8 errors and warnings. (`2581 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2581&gt;`_)

>- Added ``fix-lint`` tox environment to run automatic pep8 fixes on the code.
>  (`2582 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2582&gt;`_)

>- Turn warnings into errors in pytest&#39;s own test suite in order to catch
>  regressions due to deprecations more promptly. (`2588
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2588&gt;`_)

>- Show multiple issue links in CHANGELOG entries. (`2620
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2620&gt;`_)




>### 3.1.3

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix decode error in Python 2 for doctests in docstrings. (`2434
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2434&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised during teardown by finalizers are now suppressed until all
>  finalizers are called, with the initial exception reraised. (`2440
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2440&gt;`_)

>- Fix incorrect &quot;collected items&quot; report when specifying tests on the command-
>  line. (`2464 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2464&gt;`_)

>- ``deprecated_call`` in context-manager form now captures deprecation warnings
>  even if the same warning has already been raised. Also, ``deprecated_call``
>  will always produce the same error message (previously it would produce
>  different messages in context-manager vs. function-call mode). (`2469
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2469&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue where paths collected by pytest could have triple leading ``/``
>  characters. (`2475 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2475&gt;`_)

>- Fix internal error when trying to detect the start of a recursive traceback.
>  (`2486 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2486&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly state for which hooks the calls stop after the first non-None
>  result. (`2493 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2493&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Create invoke tasks for updating the vendored packages. (`2474
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2474&gt;`_)

>- Update copyright dates in LICENSE, README.rst and in the documentation.
>  (`2499 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2499&gt;`_)




>### 3.1.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Required options added via ``pytest_addoption`` will no longer prevent using
>  --help without passing them. (1999)

>- Respect ``python_files`` in assertion rewriting. (2121)

>- Fix recursion error detection when frames in the traceback contain objects
>  that can&#39;t be compared (like ``numpy`` arrays). (2459)

>- ``UnicodeWarning`` is issued from the internal pytest warnings plugin only
>  when the message contains non-ascii unicode (Python 2 only). (2463)

>- Added a workaround for Python 3.6 ``WindowsConsoleIO`` breaking due to Pytests&#39;s
>  ``FDCapture``. Other code using console handles might still be affected by the
>  very same issue and might require further workarounds/fixes, i.e. ``colorama``.
>  (2467)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Fix internal API links to ``pluggy`` objects. (2331)

>- Make it clear that ``pytest.xfail`` stops test execution at the calling point
>  and improve overall flow of the ``skipping`` docs. (810)




>### 3.1.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
>  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
>  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
>  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (2430)

>- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (2434)

>- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (2436)

>- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
>  context manager form. (2441)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (2390)




>### 3.1.0

>==================


>New Features
>------------

>* The ``pytest-warnings`` plugin has been integrated into the core and now ``pytest`` automatically
>  captures and displays warnings at the end of the test session.

>  .. warning::

>    This feature may disrupt test suites which apply and treat warnings themselves, and can be
>    disabled in your ``pytest.ini``:

>    .. code-block:: ini

>      [pytest]
>      addopts = -p no:warnings

>    See the `warnings documentation page &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html&gt;`_ for more
>    information.

>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Added ``junit_suite_name`` ini option to specify root ``&lt;testsuite&gt;`` name for JUnit XML reports (`533`_).

>* Added an ini option ``doctest_encoding`` to specify which encoding to use for doctest files.
>  Thanks `wheerd`_ for the PR (`2101`_).

>* ``pytest.warns`` now checks for subclass relationship rather than
>  class equality. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR (`2166`_)

>* ``pytest.raises`` now asserts that the error message matches a text or regex
>  with the ``match`` keyword argument. Thanks `Kriechi`_ for the PR.

>* ``pytest.param`` can be used to declare test parameter sets with marks and test ids.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>Changes
>-------

>* remove all internal uses of pytest_namespace hooks,
>  this is to prepare the removal of preloadconfig in pytest 4.0
>  Thanks to `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.

>* pytest now warns when a callable ids raises in a parametrized test. Thanks `fogo`_ for the PR.

>* It is now possible to skip test classes from being collected by setting a
>  ``__test__`` attribute to ``False`` in the class body (`2007`_). Thanks
>  to `syre`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Change junitxml.py to produce reports that comply with Junitxml schema.
>  If the same test fails with failure in call and then errors in teardown
>  we split testcase element into two, one containing the error and the other
>  the failure. (`2228`_) Thanks to `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Testcase reports with a ``url`` attribute will now properly write this to junitxml.
>  Thanks `fushi`_ for the PR (`1874`_).

>* Remove common items from dict comparision output when verbosity=1. Also update
>  the truncation message to make it clearer that pytest truncates all
>  assertion messages if verbosity &lt; 2 (`1512`_).
>  Thanks `mattduck`_ for the PR

>* ``--pdbcls`` no longer implies ``--pdb``. This makes it possible to use
>  ``addopts=--pdbcls=module.SomeClass`` on ``pytest.ini``. Thanks `davidszotten`_ for
>  the PR (`1952`_).

>* fix `2013`_: turn RecordedWarning into ``namedtuple``,
>  to give it a comprehensible repr while preventing unwarranted modification.

>* fix `2208`_: ensure a iteration limit for _pytest.compat.get_real_func.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and PR.

>* Hooks are now verified after collection is complete, rather than right after loading installed plugins. This
>  makes it easy to write hooks for plugins which will be loaded during collection, for example using the
>  ``pytest_plugins`` special variable (`1821`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Modify ``pytest_make_parametrize_id()`` hook to accept ``argname`` as an
>  additional parameter.
>  Thanks `unsignedint`_ for the PR.

>* Add ``venv`` to the default ``norecursedirs`` setting.
>  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the PR.

>* ``PluginManager.import_plugin`` now accepts unicode plugin names in Python 2.
>  Thanks `reutsharabani`_ for the PR.

>* fix `2308`_: When using both ``--lf`` and ``--ff``, only the last failed tests are run.
>  Thanks `ojii`_ for the PR.

>* Replace minor/patch level version numbers in the documentation with placeholders.
>  This significantly reduces change-noise as different contributors regnerate
>  the documentation on different platforms.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.

>* fix `2391`_: consider pytest_plugins on all plugin modules
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>* Fix ``AttributeError`` on ``sys.stdout.buffer`` / ``sys.stderr.buffer``
>  while using ``capsys`` fixture in python 3. (`1407`_).
>  Thanks to `asottile`_.

>* Change capture.py&#39;s ``DontReadFromInput`` class to throw ``io.UnsupportedOperation`` errors rather
>  than ValueErrors in the ``fileno`` method (`2276`_).
>  Thanks `metasyn`_ and `vlad-dragos`_ for the PR.

>* Fix exception formatting while importing modules when the exception message
>  contains non-ascii characters (`2336`_).
>  Thanks `fabioz`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Added documentation related to issue (`1937`_)
>  Thanks `skylarjhdownes`_ for the PR.

>* Allow collecting files with any file extension as Python modules (`2369`_).
>  Thanks `Kodiologist`_ for the PR.

>* Show the correct error message when collect &quot;parametrize&quot; func with wrong args (`2383`_).
>  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report and `robin0371`_ for the PR.

>### 3.0.7

>==================


>* Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules silently discarding
>  other modules when importing fails
>  Notably, importing the ``anydbm`` module is fixed. (`2248`_).
>  Thanks `pfhayes`_ for the PR.

>* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occured twice per testcase
>  element in the XML report. Thanks `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with ``--pdb``
>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.

>* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`2238`_).
>  Thanks `sirex`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to `PEP-479`_ (`2160`_).
>  Thanks `tgoodlet`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fix internal errors when an unprintable ``AssertionError`` is raised inside a test.
>  Thanks `omerhadari`_ for the PR.

>* Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (`2231`_).
>  Thanks to `vidartf`_.

>* Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (`2281`_). Thanks `fbjorn`_ for the PR.

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
>  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
>  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks `barneygale`_ for the
>  PR.

>### 3.0.6

>==================

>* pytest no longer generates ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version ``3.0.5`` (`2118`_).
>  Thanks to `nicoddemus`_ for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (`2129`_).
>  Thanks to `malinoff`_ for the PR.

>* Plugins loaded by the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are now automatically
>  considered for assertion rewriting (`2185`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (`2150`_). The type(s) of the
>  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
>  error message. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR.

>* Fix ``pytester`` internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of
>  ``zope.interface`` (`1989`_). Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (`1920`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
>  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to `eli-b`_ for the PR.

>&lt;a name=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;






### pytest 3.0.5 -> 3.2.2

>### 3.2.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Calling the deprecated `request.getfuncargvalue()` now shows the source of
>  the call. (`2681 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2681&gt;`_)

>- Allow tests declared as ``staticmethod`` to use fixtures. (`2699
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2699&gt;`_)

>- Fixed edge-case during collection: attributes which raised ``pytest.fail``
>  when accessed would abort the entire collection. (`2707
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2707&gt;`_)

>- Fix ``ReprFuncArgs`` with mixed unicode and UTF-8 args. (`2731
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2731&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- In examples on working with custom markers, add examples demonstrating the
>  usage of ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.with_args`` in comparison with
>  ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.__call__`` (`2604
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2604&gt;`_)

>- In one of the simple examples, use `pytest_collection_modifyitems()` to skip
>  tests based on a command-line option, allowing its sharing while preventing a
>  user error when acessing `pytest.config` before the argument parsing. (`2653
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2653&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Fixed minor error in &#39;Good Practices/Manual Integration&#39; code snippet.
>  (`2691 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2691&gt;`_)

>- Fixed typo in goodpractices.rst. (`2721
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2721&gt;`_)

>- Improve user guidance regarding ``--resultlog`` deprecation. (`2739
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2739&gt;`_)




>### 3.2.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fixed small terminal glitch when collecting a single test item. (`2579
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2579&gt;`_)

>- Correctly consider ``/`` as the file separator to automatically mark plugin
>  files for rewrite on Windows. (`2591 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2591&gt;`_)

>- Properly escape test names when setting ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment
>  variable. (`2644 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2644&gt;`_)

>- Fix error on Windows and Python 3.6+ when ``sys.stdout`` has been replaced
>  with a stream-like object which does not implement the full ``io`` module
>  buffer protocol. In particular this affects ``pytest-xdist`` users on the
>  aforementioned platform. (`2666 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2666&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly document which pytest features work with ``unittest``. (`2626
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2626&gt;`_)




>### 3.2.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- ``pytest.approx`` no longer supports ``&gt;``, ``&gt;=``, ``&lt;`` and ``&lt;=``
>  operators to avoid surprising/inconsistent behavior. See `the docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/builtin.htmlpytest.approx&gt;`_ for more
>  information. (`2003 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2003&gt;`_)

>- All old-style specific behavior in current classes in the pytest&#39;s API is
>  considered deprecated at this point and will be removed in a future release.
>  This affects Python 2 users only and in rare situations. (`2147
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147&gt;`_)

>- A deprecation warning is now raised when using marks for parameters
>  in ``pytest.mark.parametrize``. Use ``pytest.param`` to apply marks to
>  parameters instead. (`2427 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2427&gt;`_)


>Features
>--------

>- Add support for numpy arrays (and dicts) to approx. (`1994
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1994&gt;`_)

>- Now test function objects have a ``pytestmark`` attribute containing a list
>  of marks applied directly to the test function, as opposed to marks inherited
>  from parent classes or modules. (`2516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2516&gt;`_)

>- Collection ignores local virtualenvs by default; `--collect-in-virtualenv`
>  overrides this behavior. (`2518 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2518&gt;`_)

>- Allow class methods decorated as ``staticmethod`` to be candidates for
>  collection as a test function. (Only for Python 2.7 and above. Python 2.6
>  will still ignore static methods.) (`2528 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2528&gt;`_)

>- Introduce ``mark.with_args`` in order to allow passing functions/classes as
>  sole argument to marks. (`2540 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2540&gt;`_)

>- New ``cache_dir`` ini option: sets the directory where the contents of the
>  cache plugin are stored. Directory may be relative or absolute path: if relative path, then
>  directory is created relative to ``rootdir``, otherwise it is used as is.
>  Additionally path may contain environment variables which are expanded during
>  runtime. (`2543 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2543&gt;`_)

>- Introduce the ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment variable that is set with
>  the ``nodeid`` and stage (``setup``, ``call`` and ``teardown``) of the test
>  being currently executed. See the `documentation
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.htmlpytest-current-test-
>  environment-variable&gt;`_ for more info. (`2583 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2583&gt;`_)

>- Introduced ``pytest.mark.filterwarnings`` mark which allows overwriting the
>  warnings filter on a per test, class or module level. See the `docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.htmlpytest-mark-
>  filterwarnings&gt;`_ for more information. (`2598 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2598&gt;`_)

>- ``--last-failed`` now remembers forever when a test has failed and only
>  forgets it if it passes again. This makes it easy to fix a test suite by
>  selectively running files and fixing tests incrementally. (`2621
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2621&gt;`_)

>- New ``pytest_report_collectionfinish`` hook which allows plugins to add
>  messages to the terminal reporting after collection has been finished
>  successfully. (`2622 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2622&gt;`_)

>- Added support for `PEP-415&#39;s &lt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0415/&gt;`_
>  ``Exception.__suppress_context__``. Now if a ``raise exception from None`` is
>  caught by pytest, pytest will no longer chain the context in the test report.
>  The behavior now matches Python&#39;s traceback behavior. (`2631
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2631&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised by ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.skip`` and ``pytest.xfail``
>  now subclass BaseException, making them harder to be caught unintentionally
>  by normal code. (`580 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/580&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Set ``stdin`` to a closed ``PIPE`` in ``pytester.py.Testdir.popen()`` for
>  avoid unwanted interactive ``pdb`` (`2023 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2023&gt;`_)

>- Add missing ``encoding`` attribute to ``sys.std*`` streams when using
>  ``capsys`` capture mode. (`2375 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2375&gt;`_)

>- Fix terminal color changing to black on Windows if ``colorama`` is imported
>  in a ``conftest.py`` file. (`2510 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2510&gt;`_)

>- Fix line number when reporting summary of skipped tests. (`2548
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2548&gt;`_)

>- capture: ensure that EncodedFile.name is a string. (`2555
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2555&gt;`_)

>- The options ``--fixtures`` and ``--fixtures-per-test`` will now keep
>  indentation within docstrings. (`2574 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2574&gt;`_)

>- doctests line numbers are now reported correctly, fixing `pytest-sugar122
>  &lt;https://github.com/Frozenball/pytest-sugar/issues/122&gt;`_. (`2610
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2610&gt;`_)

>- Fix non-determinism in order of fixture collection. Adds new dependency
>  (ordereddict) for Python 2.6. (`920 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/920&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Clarify ``pytest_configure`` hook call order. (`2539
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2539&gt;`_)

>- Extend documentation for testing plugin code with the ``pytester`` plugin.
>  (`971 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/971&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Update help message for ``--strict`` to make it clear it only deals with
>  unregistered markers, not warnings. (`2444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2444&gt;`_)

>- Internal code move: move code for pytest.approx/pytest.raises to own files in
>  order to cut down the size of python.py (`2489 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2489&gt;`_)

>- Renamed the utility function ``_pytest.compat._escape_strings`` to
>  ``_ascii_escaped`` to better communicate the function&#39;s purpose. (`2533
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2533&gt;`_)

>- Improve error message for CollectError with skip/skipif. (`2546
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2546&gt;`_)

>- Emit warning about ``yield`` tests being deprecated only once per generator.
>  (`2562 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2562&gt;`_)

>- Ensure final collected line doesn&#39;t include artifacts of previous write.
>  (`2571 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2571&gt;`_)

>- Fixed all flake8 errors and warnings. (`2581 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2581&gt;`_)

>- Added ``fix-lint`` tox environment to run automatic pep8 fixes on the code.
>  (`2582 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2582&gt;`_)

>- Turn warnings into errors in pytest&#39;s own test suite in order to catch
>  regressions due to deprecations more promptly. (`2588
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2588&gt;`_)

>- Show multiple issue links in CHANGELOG entries. (`2620
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2620&gt;`_)




>### 3.1.3

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix decode error in Python 2 for doctests in docstrings. (`2434
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2434&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised during teardown by finalizers are now suppressed until all
>  finalizers are called, with the initial exception reraised. (`2440
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2440&gt;`_)

>- Fix incorrect &quot;collected items&quot; report when specifying tests on the command-
>  line. (`2464 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2464&gt;`_)

>- ``deprecated_call`` in context-manager form now captures deprecation warnings
>  even if the same warning has already been raised. Also, ``deprecated_call``
>  will always produce the same error message (previously it would produce
>  different messages in context-manager vs. function-call mode). (`2469
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2469&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue where paths collected by pytest could have triple leading ``/``
>  characters. (`2475 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2475&gt;`_)

>- Fix internal error when trying to detect the start of a recursive traceback.
>  (`2486 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2486&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly state for which hooks the calls stop after the first non-None
>  result. (`2493 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2493&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Create invoke tasks for updating the vendored packages. (`2474
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2474&gt;`_)

>- Update copyright dates in LICENSE, README.rst and in the documentation.
>  (`2499 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2499&gt;`_)




>### 3.1.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Required options added via ``pytest_addoption`` will no longer prevent using
>  --help without passing them. (1999)

>- Respect ``python_files`` in assertion rewriting. (2121)

>- Fix recursion error detection when frames in the traceback contain objects
>  that can&#39;t be compared (like ``numpy`` arrays). (2459)

>- ``UnicodeWarning`` is issued from the internal pytest warnings plugin only
>  when the message contains non-ascii unicode (Python 2 only). (2463)

>- Added a workaround for Python 3.6 ``WindowsConsoleIO`` breaking due to Pytests&#39;s
>  ``FDCapture``. Other code using console handles might still be affected by the
>  very same issue and might require further workarounds/fixes, i.e. ``colorama``.
>  (2467)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Fix internal API links to ``pluggy`` objects. (2331)

>- Make it clear that ``pytest.xfail`` stops test execution at the calling point
>  and improve overall flow of the ``skipping`` docs. (810)




>### 3.1.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
>  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
>  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
>  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (2430)

>- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (2434)

>- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (2436)

>- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
>  context manager form. (2441)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (2390)




>### 3.1.0

>==================


>New Features
>------------

>* The ``pytest-warnings`` plugin has been integrated into the core and now ``pytest`` automatically
>  captures and displays warnings at the end of the test session.

>  .. warning::

>    This feature may disrupt test suites which apply and treat warnings themselves, and can be
>    disabled in your ``pytest.ini``:

>    .. code-block:: ini

>      [pytest]
>      addopts = -p no:warnings

>    See the `warnings documentation page &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html&gt;`_ for more
>    information.

>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Added ``junit_suite_name`` ini option to specify root ``&lt;testsuite&gt;`` name for JUnit XML reports (`533`_).

>* Added an ini option ``doctest_encoding`` to specify which encoding to use for doctest files.
>  Thanks `wheerd`_ for the PR (`2101`_).

>* ``pytest.warns`` now checks for subclass relationship rather than
>  class equality. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR (`2166`_)

>* ``pytest.raises`` now asserts that the error message matches a text or regex
>  with the ``match`` keyword argument. Thanks `Kriechi`_ for the PR.

>* ``pytest.param`` can be used to declare test parameter sets with marks and test ids.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>Changes
>-------

>* remove all internal uses of pytest_namespace hooks,
>  this is to prepare the removal of preloadconfig in pytest 4.0
>  Thanks to `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.

>* pytest now warns when a callable ids raises in a parametrized test. Thanks `fogo`_ for the PR.

>* It is now possible to skip test classes from being collected by setting a
>  ``__test__`` attribute to ``False`` in the class body (`2007`_). Thanks
>  to `syre`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Change junitxml.py to produce reports that comply with Junitxml schema.
>  If the same test fails with failure in call and then errors in teardown
>  we split testcase element into two, one containing the error and the other
>  the failure. (`2228`_) Thanks to `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Testcase reports with a ``url`` attribute will now properly write this to junitxml.
>  Thanks `fushi`_ for the PR (`1874`_).

>* Remove common items from dict comparision output when verbosity=1. Also update
>  the truncation message to make it clearer that pytest truncates all
>  assertion messages if verbosity &lt; 2 (`1512`_).
>  Thanks `mattduck`_ for the PR

>* ``--pdbcls`` no longer implies ``--pdb``. This makes it possible to use
>  ``addopts=--pdbcls=module.SomeClass`` on ``pytest.ini``. Thanks `davidszotten`_ for
>  the PR (`1952`_).

>* fix `2013`_: turn RecordedWarning into ``namedtuple``,
>  to give it a comprehensible repr while preventing unwarranted modification.

>* fix `2208`_: ensure a iteration limit for _pytest.compat.get_real_func.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and PR.

>* Hooks are now verified after collection is complete, rather than right after loading installed plugins. This
>  makes it easy to write hooks for plugins which will be loaded during collection, for example using the
>  ``pytest_plugins`` special variable (`1821`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Modify ``pytest_make_parametrize_id()`` hook to accept ``argname`` as an
>  additional parameter.
>  Thanks `unsignedint`_ for the PR.

>* Add ``venv`` to the default ``norecursedirs`` setting.
>  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the PR.

>* ``PluginManager.import_plugin`` now accepts unicode plugin names in Python 2.
>  Thanks `reutsharabani`_ for the PR.

>* fix `2308`_: When using both ``--lf`` and ``--ff``, only the last failed tests are run.
>  Thanks `ojii`_ for the PR.

>* Replace minor/patch level version numbers in the documentation with placeholders.
>  This significantly reduces change-noise as different contributors regnerate
>  the documentation on different platforms.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.

>* fix `2391`_: consider pytest_plugins on all plugin modules
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>* Fix ``AttributeError`` on ``sys.stdout.buffer`` / ``sys.stderr.buffer``

>### 3.0.7

>==================


>* Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules silently discarding
>  other modules when importing fails
>  Notably, importing the ``anydbm`` module is fixed. (`2248`_).
>  Thanks `pfhayes`_ for the PR.

>* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occured twice per testcase
>  element in the XML report. Thanks `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with ``--pdb``
>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.

>* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`2238`_).
>  Thanks `sirex`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to `PEP-479`_ (`2160`_).

>* Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (`2231`_).
>  Thanks to `vidartf`_.

>* Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (`2281`_). Thanks `fbjorn`_ for the PR.

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
>  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
>  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks `barneygale`_ for the
>  PR.

>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
>  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to `eli-b`_ for the PR.

>&lt;a name=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;






### pytest 3.0.5 -> 3.2.2

>### 3.2.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Calling the deprecated `request.getfuncargvalue()` now shows the source of
>  the call. (`2681 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2681&gt;`_)

>- Allow tests declared as ``staticmethod`` to use fixtures. (`2699
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2699&gt;`_)

>- Fixed edge-case during collection: attributes which raised ``pytest.fail``
>  when accessed would abort the entire collection. (`2707
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2707&gt;`_)

>- Fix ``ReprFuncArgs`` with mixed unicode and UTF-8 args. (`2731
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2731&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- In examples on working with custom markers, add examples demonstrating the
>  usage of ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.with_args`` in comparison with
>  ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.__call__`` (`2604
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2604&gt;`_)

>- In one of the simple examples, use `pytest_collection_modifyitems()` to skip
>  tests based on a command-line option, allowing its sharing while preventing a
>  user error when acessing `pytest.config` before the argument parsing. (`2653
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2653&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Fixed minor error in &#39;Good Practices/Manual Integration&#39; code snippet.
>  (`2691 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2691&gt;`_)

>- Fixed typo in goodpractices.rst. (`2721
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2721&gt;`_)

>- Improve user guidance regarding ``--resultlog`` deprecation. (`2739
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2739&gt;`_)




>### 3.2.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fixed small terminal glitch when collecting a single test item. (`2579
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2579&gt;`_)

>- Correctly consider ``/`` as the file separator to automatically mark plugin
>  files for rewrite on Windows. (`2591 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2591&gt;`_)

>- Properly escape test names when setting ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment
>  variable. (`2644 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2644&gt;`_)

>- Fix error on Windows and Python 3.6+ when ``sys.stdout`` has been replaced
>  with a stream-like object which does not implement the full ``io`` module
>  buffer protocol. In particular this affects ``pytest-xdist`` users on the
>  aforementioned platform. (`2666 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2666&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly document which pytest features work with ``unittest``. (`2626
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2626&gt;`_)




>### 3.2.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- ``pytest.approx`` no longer supports ``&gt;``, ``&gt;=``, ``&lt;`` and ``&lt;=``
>  operators to avoid surprising/inconsistent behavior. See `the docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/builtin.htmlpytest.approx&gt;`_ for more
>  information. (`2003 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2003&gt;`_)

>- All old-style specific behavior in current classes in the pytest&#39;s API is
>  considered deprecated at this point and will be removed in a future release.
>  This affects Python 2 users only and in rare situations. (`2147
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147&gt;`_)

>- A deprecation warning is now raised when using marks for parameters
>  in ``pytest.mark.parametrize``. Use ``pytest.param`` to apply marks to
>  parameters instead. (`2427 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2427&gt;`_)


>Features
>--------

>- Add support for numpy arrays (and dicts) to approx. (`1994
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1994&gt;`_)

>- Now test function objects have a ``pytestmark`` attribute containing a list
>  of marks applied directly to the test function, as opposed to marks inherited
>  from parent classes or modules. (`2516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2516&gt;`_)

>- Collection ignores local virtualenvs by default; `--collect-in-virtualenv`
>  overrides this behavior. (`2518 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2518&gt;`_)

>- Allow class methods decorated as ``staticmethod`` to be candidates for
>  collection as a test function. (Only for Python 2.7 and above. Python 2.6
>  will still ignore static methods.) (`2528 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2528&gt;`_)

>- Introduce ``mark.with_args`` in order to allow passing functions/classes as
>  sole argument to marks. (`2540 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2540&gt;`_)

>- New ``cache_dir`` ini option: sets the directory where the contents of the
>  cache plugin are stored. Directory may be relative or absolute path: if relative path, then
>  directory is created relative to ``rootdir``, otherwise it is used as is.
>  Additionally path may contain environment variables which are expanded during
>  runtime. (`2543 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2543&gt;`_)

>- Introduce the ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment variable that is set with
>  the ``nodeid`` and stage (``setup``, ``call`` and ``teardown``) of the test
>  being currently executed. See the `documentation
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.htmlpytest-current-test-
>  environment-variable&gt;`_ for more info. (`2583 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2583&gt;`_)

>- Introduced ``pytest.mark.filterwarnings`` mark which allows overwriting the
>  warnings filter on a per test, class or module level. See the `docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.htmlpytest-mark-
>  filterwarnings&gt;`_ for more information. (`2598 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2598&gt;`_)

>- ``--last-failed`` now remembers forever when a test has failed and only
>  forgets it if it passes again. This makes it easy to fix a test suite by
>  selectively running files and fixing tests incrementally. (`2621
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2621&gt;`_)

>- New ``pytest_report_collectionfinish`` hook which allows plugins to add
>  messages to the terminal reporting after collection has been finished
>  successfully. (`2622 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2622&gt;`_)

>- Added support for `PEP-415&#39;s &lt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0415/&gt;`_
>  ``Exception.__suppress_context__``. Now if a ``raise exception from None`` is
>  caught by pytest, pytest will no longer chain the context in the test report.
>  The behavior now matches Python&#39;s traceback behavior. (`2631
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2631&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised by ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.skip`` and ``pytest.xfail``
>  now subclass BaseException, making them harder to be caught unintentionally
>  by normal code. (`580 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/580&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Set ``stdin`` to a closed ``PIPE`` in ``pytester.py.Testdir.popen()`` for
>  avoid unwanted interactive ``pdb`` (`2023 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2023&gt;`_)

>- Add missing ``encoding`` attribute to ``sys.std*`` streams when using
>  ``capsys`` capture mode. (`2375 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2375&gt;`_)

>- Fix terminal color changing to black on Windows if ``colorama`` is imported
>  in a ``conftest.py`` file. (`2510 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2510&gt;`_)

>- Fix line number when reporting summary of skipped tests. (`2548
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2548&gt;`_)

>- capture: ensure that EncodedFile.name is a string. (`2555
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2555&gt;`_)

>- The options ``--fixtures`` and ``--fixtures-per-test`` will now keep
>  indentation within docstrings. (`2574 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2574&gt;`_)

>- doctests line numbers are now reported correctly, fixing `pytest-sugar122
>  &lt;https://github.com/Frozenball/pytest-sugar/issues/122&gt;`_. (`2610
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2610&gt;`_)

>- Fix non-determinism in order of fixture collection. Adds new dependency
>  (ordereddict) for Python 2.6. (`920 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/920&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Clarify ``pytest_configure`` hook call order. (`2539
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2539&gt;`_)

>- Extend documentation for testing plugin code with the ``pytester`` plugin.
>  (`971 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/971&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Update help message for ``--strict`` to make it clear it only deals with
>  unregistered markers, not warnings. (`2444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2444&gt;`_)

>- Internal code move: move code for pytest.approx/pytest.raises to own files in
>  order to cut down the size of python.py (`2489 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2489&gt;`_)

>- Renamed the utility function ``_pytest.compat._escape_strings`` to
>  ``_ascii_escaped`` to better communicate the function&#39;s purpose. (`2533
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2533&gt;`_)

>- Improve error message for CollectError with skip/skipif. (`2546
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2546&gt;`_)

>- Emit warning about ``yield`` tests being deprecated only once per generator.
>  (`2562 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2562&gt;`_)

>- Ensure final collected line doesn&#39;t include artifacts of previous write.
>  (`2571 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2571&gt;`_)

>- Fixed all flake8 errors and warnings. (`2581 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2581&gt;`_)

>- Added ``fix-lint`` tox environment to run automatic pep8 fixes on the code.
>  (`2582 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2582&gt;`_)

>- Turn warnings into errors in pytest&#39;s own test suite in order to catch

>- Show multiple issue links in CHANGELOG entries. (`2620
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2620&gt;`_)




>### 3.1.3

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix decode error in Python 2 for doctests in docstrings. (`2434
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2434&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised during teardown by finalizers are now suppressed until all
>  finalizers are called, with the initial exception reraised. (`2440
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2440&gt;`_)

>- Fix incorrect &quot;collected items&quot; report when specifying tests on the command-
>  line. (`2464 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2464&gt;`_)

>- ``deprecated_call`` in context-manager form now captures deprecation warnings
>  even if the same warning has already been raised. Also, ``deprecated_call``
>  will always produce the same error message (previously it would produce
>  different messages in context-manager vs. function-call mode). (`2469
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2469&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue where paths collected by pytest could have triple leading ``/``
>  characters. (`2475 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2475&gt;`_)

>- Fix internal error when trying to detect the start of a recursive traceback.
>  (`2486 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2486&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly state for which hooks the calls stop after the first non-None
>  result. (`2493 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2493&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Create invoke tasks for updating the vendored packages. (`2474
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2474&gt;`_)

>- Update copyright dates in LICENSE, README.rst and in the documentation.
>  (`2499 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2499&gt;`_)




>### 3.1.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Required options added via ``pytest_addoption`` will no longer prevent using
>  --help without passing them. (1999)

>- Respect ``python_files`` in assertion rewriting. (2121)

>- Fix recursion error detection when frames in the traceback contain objects
>  that can&#39;t be compared (like ``numpy`` arrays). (2459)

>- ``UnicodeWarning`` is issued from the internal pytest warnings plugin only
>  when the message contains non-ascii unicode (Python 2 only). (2463)

>- Added a workaround for Python 3.6 ``WindowsConsoleIO`` breaking due to Pytests&#39;s
>  ``FDCapture``. Other code using console handles might still be affected by the
>  very same issue and might require further workarounds/fixes, i.e. ``colorama``.
>  (2467)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Fix internal API links to ``pluggy`` objects. (2331)

>- Make it clear that ``pytest.xfail`` stops test execution at the calling point
>  and improve overall flow of the ``skipping`` docs. (810)




>### 3.1.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
>  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
>  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
>  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (2430)

>- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (2434)

>- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (2436)

>- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
>  context manager form. (2441)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (2390)




>### 3.1.0

>==================


>New Features
>------------

>* The ``pytest-warnings`` plugin has been integrated into the core and now ``pytest`` automatically
>  captures and displays warnings at the end of the test session.

>  .. warning::

>    This feature may disrupt test suites which apply and treat warnings themselves, and can be
>    disabled in your ``pytest.ini``:

>    .. code-block:: ini

>      [pytest]
>      addopts = -p no:warnings

>    See the `warnings documentation page &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html&gt;`_ for more
>    information.

>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Added ``junit_suite_name`` ini option to specify root ``&lt;testsuite&gt;`` name for JUnit XML reports (`533`_).

>* Added an ini option ``doctest_encoding`` to specify which encoding to use for doctest files.
>  Thanks `wheerd`_ for the PR (`2101`_).

>* ``pytest.warns`` now checks for subclass relationship rather than
>  class equality. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR (`2166`_)

>* ``pytest.raises`` now asserts that the error message matches a text or regex
>  with the ``match`` keyword argument. Thanks `Kriechi`_ for the PR.

>* ``pytest.param`` can be used to declare test parameter sets with marks and test ids.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>Changes
>-------

>* remove all internal uses of pytest_namespace hooks,
>  this is to prepare the removal of preloadconfig in pytest 4.0
>  Thanks to `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.

>* pytest now warns when a callable ids raises in a parametrized test. Thanks `fogo`_ for the PR.

>* It is now possible to skip test classes from being collected by setting a
>  ``__test__`` attribute to ``False`` in the class body (`2007`_). Thanks
>  to `syre`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Change junitxml.py to produce reports that comply with Junitxml schema.
>  If the same test fails with failure in call and then errors in teardown
>  we split testcase element into two, one containing the error and the other
>  the failure. (`2228`_) Thanks to `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Testcase reports with a ``url`` attribute will now properly write this to junitxml.
>  Thanks `fushi`_ for the PR (`1874`_).

>* Remove common items from dict comparision output when verbosity=1. Also update
>  the truncation message to make it clearer that pytest truncates all
>  assertion messages if verbosity &lt; 2 (`1512`_).
>  Thanks `mattduck`_ for the PR

>* ``--pdbcls`` no longer implies ``--pdb``. This makes it possible to use
>  ``addopts=--pdbcls=module.SomeClass`` on ``pytest.ini``. Thanks `davidszotten`_ for
>  the PR (`1952`_).

>* fix `2013`_: turn RecordedWarning into ``namedtuple``,
>  to give it a comprehensible repr while preventing unwarranted modification.

>* fix `2208`_: ensure a iteration limit for _pytest.compat.get_real_func.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and PR.

>* Hooks are now verified after collection is complete, rather than right after loading installed plugins. This
>  makes it easy to write hooks for plugins which will be loaded during collection, for example using the
>  ``pytest_plugins`` special variable (`1821`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Modify ``pytest_make_parametrize_id()`` hook to accept ``argname`` as an
>  additional parameter.
>  Thanks `unsignedint`_ for the PR.

>* Add ``venv`` to the default ``norecursedirs`` setting.
>  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the PR.

>* ``PluginManager.import_plugin`` now accepts unicode plugin names in Python 2.
>  Thanks `reutsharabani`_ for the PR.

>* fix `2308`_: When using both ``--lf`` and ``--ff``, only the last failed tests are run.
>  Thanks `ojii`_ for the PR.

>* Replace minor/patch level version numbers in the documentation with placeholders.
>  This significantly reduces change-noise as different contributors regnerate
>  the documentation on different platforms.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.

>* fix `2391`_: consider pytest_plugins on all plugin modules
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>* Fix ``AttributeError`` on ``sys.stdout.buffer`` / ``sys.stderr.buffer``
>  while using ``capsys`` fixture in python 3. (`1407`_).
>  Thanks to `asottile`_.

>* Change capture.py&#39;s ``DontReadFromInput`` class to throw ``io.UnsupportedOperation`` errors rather
>  than ValueErrors in the ``fileno`` method (`2276`_).
>  Thanks `metasyn`_ and `vlad-dragos`_ for the PR.

>* Fix exception formatting while importing modules when the exception message
>  contains non-ascii characters (`2336`_).
>  Thanks `fabioz`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Added documentation related to issue (`1937`_)
>  Thanks `skylarjhdownes`_ for the PR.

>* Allow collecting files with any file extension as Python modules (`2369`_).
>  Thanks `Kodiologist`_ for the PR.

>* Show the correct error message when collect &quot;parametrize&quot; func with wrong args (`2383`_).
>  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report and `robin0371`_ for the PR.

>### 3.0.7

>==================


>* Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules silently discarding
>  other modules when importing fails
>  Notably, importing the ``anydbm`` module is fixed. (`2248`_).
>  Thanks `pfhayes`_ for the PR.

>* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occured twice per testcase
>  element in the XML report. Thanks `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with ``--pdb``
>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.

>* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`2238`_).
>  Thanks `sirex`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to `PEP-479`_ (`2160`_).
>  Thanks `tgoodlet`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fix internal errors when an unprintable ``AssertionError`` is raised inside a test.
>  Thanks `omerhadari`_ for the PR.

>* Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (`2231`_).
>  Thanks to `vidartf`_.

>* Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (`2281`_). Thanks `fbjorn`_ for the PR.

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
>  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
>  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks `barneygale`_ for the
>  PR.

>  Thanks to `nicoddemus`_ for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (`2129`_).
>  Thanks to `malinoff`_ for the PR.

>  considered for assertion rewriting (`2185`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (`2150`_). The type(s) of the
>  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
>  error message. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR.

>  ``zope.interface`` (`1989`_). Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (`1920`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
>  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to `eli-b`_ for the PR.

>&lt;a name=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;






### pytest 3.0.5 -> 3.2.2

>### 3.2.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Calling the deprecated `request.getfuncargvalue()` now shows the source of
>  the call. (`2681 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2681&gt;`_)

>- Allow tests declared as ``staticmethod`` to use fixtures. (`2699
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2699&gt;`_)

>- Fixed edge-case during collection: attributes which raised ``pytest.fail``
>  when accessed would abort the entire collection. (`2707
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2707&gt;`_)

>- Fix ``ReprFuncArgs`` with mixed unicode and UTF-8 args. (`2731
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2731&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- In examples on working with custom markers, add examples demonstrating the
>  usage of ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.with_args`` in comparison with
>  ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.__call__`` (`2604
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2604&gt;`_)

>- In one of the simple examples, use `pytest_collection_modifyitems()` to skip
>  tests based on a command-line option, allowing its sharing while preventing a
>  user error when acessing `pytest.config` before the argument parsing. (`2653
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2653&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Fixed minor error in &#39;Good Practices/Manual Integration&#39; code snippet.
>  (`2691 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2691&gt;`_)

>- Fixed typo in goodpractices.rst. (`2721
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2721&gt;`_)

>- Improve user guidance regarding ``--resultlog`` deprecation. (`2739
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2739&gt;`_)




>### 3.2.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fixed small terminal glitch when collecting a single test item. (`2579
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2579&gt;`_)

>- Correctly consider ``/`` as the file separator to automatically mark plugin
>  files for rewrite on Windows. (`2591 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2591&gt;`_)

>- Properly escape test names when setting ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment
>  variable. (`2644 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2644&gt;`_)

>- Fix error on Windows and Python 3.6+ when ``sys.stdout`` has been replaced
>  with a stream-like object which does not implement the full ``io`` module
>  buffer protocol. In particular this affects ``pytest-xdist`` users on the
>  aforementioned platform. (`2666 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2666&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly document which pytest features work with ``unittest``. (`2626
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2626&gt;`_)




>### 3.2.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- ``pytest.approx`` no longer supports ``&gt;``, ``&gt;=``, ``&lt;`` and ``&lt;=``
>  operators to avoid surprising/inconsistent behavior. See `the docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/builtin.htmlpytest.approx&gt;`_ for more
>  information. (`2003 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2003&gt;`_)

>- All old-style specific behavior in current classes in the pytest&#39;s API is
>  considered deprecated at this point and will be removed in a future release.
>  This affects Python 2 users only and in rare situations. (`2147
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147&gt;`_)

>- A deprecation warning is now raised when using marks for parameters
>  in ``pytest.mark.parametrize``. Use ``pytest.param`` to apply marks to
>  parameters instead. (`2427 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2427&gt;`_)


>Features
>--------

>- Add support for numpy arrays (and dicts) to approx. (`1994
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1994&gt;`_)

>- Now test function objects have a ``pytestmark`` attribute containing a list
>  of marks applied directly to the test function, as opposed to marks inherited
>  from parent classes or modules. (`2516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2516&gt;`_)

>- Collection ignores local virtualenvs by default; `--collect-in-virtualenv`
>  overrides this behavior. (`2518 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2518&gt;`_)

>- Allow class methods decorated as ``staticmethod`` to be candidates for
>  collection as a test function. (Only for Python 2.7 and above. Python 2.6
>  will still ignore static methods.) (`2528 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2528&gt;`_)

>- Introduce ``mark.with_args`` in order to allow passing functions/classes as
>  sole argument to marks. (`2540 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2540&gt;`_)

>- New ``cache_dir`` ini option: sets the directory where the contents of the
>  cache plugin are stored. Directory may be relative or absolute path: if relative path, then
>  directory is created relative to ``rootdir``, otherwise it is used as is.
>  Additionally path may contain environment variables which are expanded during
>  runtime. (`2543 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2543&gt;`_)

>- Introduce the ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment variable that is set with
>  the ``nodeid`` and stage (``setup``, ``call`` and ``teardown``) of the test
>  being currently executed. See the `documentation
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.htmlpytest-current-test-
>  environment-variable&gt;`_ for more info. (`2583 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2583&gt;`_)

>- Introduced ``pytest.mark.filterwarnings`` mark which allows overwriting the
>  warnings filter on a per test, class or module level. See the `docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.htmlpytest-mark-
>  filterwarnings&gt;`_ for more information. (`2598 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2598&gt;`_)

>- ``--last-failed`` now remembers forever when a test has failed and only
>  forgets it if it passes again. This makes it easy to fix a test suite by
>  selectively running files and fixing tests incrementally. (`2621
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2621&gt;`_)

>- New ``pytest_report_collectionfinish`` hook which allows plugins to add
>  messages to the terminal reporting after collection has been finished
>  successfully. (`2622 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2622&gt;`_)

>- Added support for `PEP-415&#39;s &lt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0415/&gt;`_
>  ``Exception.__suppress_context__``. Now if a ``raise exception from None`` is
>  caught by pytest, pytest will no longer chain the context in the test report.
>  The behavior now matches Python&#39;s traceback behavior. (`2631
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2631&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised by ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.skip`` and ``pytest.xfail``
>  now subclass BaseException, making them harder to be caught unintentionally
>  by normal code. (`580 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/580&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Set ``stdin`` to a closed ``PIPE`` in ``pytester.py.Testdir.popen()`` for
>  avoid unwanted interactive ``pdb`` (`2023 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2023&gt;`_)

>- Add missing ``encoding`` attribute to ``sys.std*`` streams when using
>  ``capsys`` capture mode. (`2375 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2375&gt;`_)

>- Fix terminal color changing to black on Windows if ``colorama`` is imported
>  in a ``conftest.py`` file. (`2510 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2510&gt;`_)

>- Fix line number when reporting summary of skipped tests. (`2548
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2548&gt;`_)

>- capture: ensure that EncodedFile.name is a string. (`2555
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2555&gt;`_)

>- The options ``--fixtures`` and ``--fixtures-per-test`` will now keep
>  indentation within docstrings. (`2574 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2574&gt;`_)

>- doctests line numbers are now reported correctly, fixing `pytest-sugar122
>  &lt;https://github.com/Frozenball/pytest-sugar/issues/122&gt;`_. (`2610
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2610&gt;`_)

>- Fix non-determinism in order of fixture collection. Adds new dependency
>  (ordereddict) for Python 2.6. (`920 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/920&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Clarify ``pytest_configure`` hook call order. (`2539
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2539&gt;`_)

>- Extend documentation for testing plugin code with the ``pytester`` plugin.
>  (`971 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/971&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Update help message for ``--strict`` to make it clear it only deals with
>  unregistered markers, not warnings. (`2444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2444&gt;`_)

>- Internal code move: move code for pytest.approx/pytest.raises to own files in
>  order to cut down the size of python.py (`2489 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2489&gt;`_)

>- Renamed the utility function ``_pytest.compat._escape_strings`` to
>  ``_ascii_escaped`` to better communicate the function&#39;s purpose. (`2533
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2533&gt;`_)

>- Improve error message for CollectError with skip/skipif. (`2546
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2546&gt;`_)

>- Emit warning about ``yield`` tests being deprecated only once per generator.
>  (`2562 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2562&gt;`_)

>- Ensure final collected line doesn&#39;t include artifacts of previous write.
>  (`2571 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2571&gt;`_)

>- Fixed all flake8 errors and warnings. (`2581 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2581&gt;`_)

>- Added ``fix-lint`` tox environment to run automatic pep8 fixes on the code.
>  (`2582 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2582&gt;`_)

>- Turn warnings into errors in pytest&#39;s own test suite in order to catch
>  regressions due to deprecations more promptly. (`2588
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2588&gt;`_)

>- Show multiple issue links in CHANGELOG entries. (`2620
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2620&gt;`_)




>### 3.1.3

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix decode error in Python 2 for doctests in docstrings. (`2434
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2434&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised during teardown by finalizers are now suppressed until all
>  finalizers are called, with the initial exception reraised. (`2440
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2440&gt;`_)

>- Fix incorrect &quot;collected items&quot; report when specifying tests on the command-
>  line. (`2464 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2464&gt;`_)

>- ``deprecated_call`` in context-manager form now captures deprecation warnings
>  even if the same warning has already been raised. Also, ``deprecated_call``
>  will always produce the same error message (previously it would produce
>  different messages in context-manager vs. function-call mode). (`2469
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2469&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue where paths collected by pytest could have triple leading ``/``
>  characters. (`2475 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2475&gt;`_)

>- Fix internal error when trying to detect the start of a recursive traceback.
>  (`2486 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2486&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly state for which hooks the calls stop after the first non-None
>  result. (`2493 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2493&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Create invoke tasks for updating the vendored packages. (`2474
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2474&gt;`_)

>- Update copyright dates in LICENSE, README.rst and in the documentation.
>  (`2499 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2499&gt;`_)




>### 3.1.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Required options added via ``pytest_addoption`` will no longer prevent using
>  --help without passing them. (1999)

>- Respect ``python_files`` in assertion rewriting. (2121)

>- Fix recursion error detection when frames in the traceback contain objects
>  that can&#39;t be compared (like ``numpy`` arrays). (2459)

>- ``UnicodeWarning`` is issued from the internal pytest warnings plugin only
>  when the message contains non-ascii unicode (Python 2 only). (2463)

>- Added a workaround for Python 3.6 ``WindowsConsoleIO`` breaking due to Pytests&#39;s
>  ``FDCapture``. Other code using console handles might still be affected by the
>  very same issue and might require further workarounds/fixes, i.e. ``colorama``.
>  (2467)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Fix internal API links to ``pluggy`` objects. (2331)

>- Make it clear that ``pytest.xfail`` stops test execution at the calling point
>  and improve overall flow of the ``skipping`` docs. (810)




>### 3.1.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
>  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
>  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
>  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (2430)

>- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (2434)

>- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (2436)

>- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
>  context manager form. (2441)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (2390)




>### 3.1.0

>==================


>New Features
>------------

>* The ``pytest-warnings`` plugin has been integrated into the core and now ``pytest`` automatically
>  captures and displays warnings at the end of the test session.

>  .. warning::

>    This feature may disrupt test suites which apply and treat warnings themselves, and can be
>    disabled in your ``pytest.ini``:

>    .. code-block:: ini

>      [pytest]
>      addopts = -p no:warnings

>    See the `warnings documentation page &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html&gt;`_ for more
>    information.

>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Added ``junit_suite_name`` ini option to specify root ``&lt;testsuite&gt;`` name for JUnit XML reports (`533`_).

>* Added an ini option ``doctest_encoding`` to specify which encoding to use for doctest files.
>  Thanks `wheerd`_ for the PR (`2101`_).

>* ``pytest.warns`` now checks for subclass relationship rather than
>  class equality. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR (`2166`_)

>* ``pytest.raises`` now asserts that the error message matches a text or regex
>  with the ``match`` keyword argument. Thanks `Kriechi`_ for the PR.

>* ``pytest.param`` can be used to declare test parameter sets with marks and test ids.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>Changes
>-------

>* remove all internal uses of pytest_namespace hooks,
>  this is to prepare the removal of preloadconfig in pytest 4.0
>  Thanks to `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.

>* pytest now warns when a callable ids raises in a parametrized test. Thanks `fogo`_ for the PR.

>* It is now possible to skip test classes from being collected by setting a
>  ``__test__`` attribute to ``False`` in the class body (`2007`_). Thanks
>  to `syre`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Change junitxml.py to produce reports that comply with Junitxml schema.
>  If the same test fails with failure in call and then errors in teardown
>  we split testcase element into two, one containing the error and the other
>  the failure. (`2228`_) Thanks to `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Testcase reports with a ``url`` attribute will now properly write this to junitxml.
>  Thanks `fushi`_ for the PR (`1874`_).

>* Remove common items from dict comparision output when verbosity=1. Also update
>  the truncation message to make it clearer that pytest truncates all
>  assertion messages if verbosity &lt; 2 (`1512`_).
>  Thanks `mattduck`_ for the PR

>* ``--pdbcls`` no longer implies ``--pdb``. This makes it possible to use
>  ``addopts=--pdbcls=module.SomeClass`` on ``pytest.ini``. Thanks `davidszotten`_ for
>  the PR (`1952`_).

>* fix `2013`_: turn RecordedWarning into ``namedtuple``,
>  to give it a comprehensible repr while preventing unwarranted modification.

>* fix `2208`_: ensure a iteration limit for _pytest.compat.get_real_func.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and PR.

>* Hooks are now verified after collection is complete, rather than right after loading installed plugins. This
>  makes it easy to write hooks for plugins which will be loaded during collection, for example using the
>  ``pytest_plugins`` special variable (`1821`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Modify ``pytest_make_parametrize_id()`` hook to accept ``argname`` as an
>  additional parameter.
>  Thanks `unsignedint`_ for the PR.

>* Add ``venv`` to the default ``norecursedirs`` setting.
>  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the PR.

>* ``PluginManager.import_plugin`` now accepts unicode plugin names in Python 2.
>  Thanks `reutsharabani`_ for the PR.

>* fix `2308`_: When using both ``--lf`` and ``--ff``, only the last failed tests are run.
>  Thanks `ojii`_ for the PR.

>* Replace minor/patch level version numbers in the documentation with placeholders.
>  This significantly reduces change-noise as different contributors regnerate
>  the documentation on different platforms.
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.

>* fix `2391`_: consider pytest_plugins on all plugin modules
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>* Fix ``AttributeError`` on ``sys.stdout.buffer`` / ``sys.stderr.buffer``
>  while using ``capsys`` fixture in python 3. (`1407`_).
>  Thanks to `asottile`_.

>* Change capture.py&#39;s ``DontReadFromInput`` class to throw ``io.UnsupportedOperation`` errors rather
>  than ValueErrors in the ``fileno`` method (`2276`_).
>  Thanks `metasyn`_ and `vlad-dragos`_ for the PR.

>* Fix exception formatting while importing modules when the exception message
>  contains non-ascii characters (`2336`_).
>  Thanks `fabioz`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Added documentation related to issue (`1937`_)
>  Thanks `skylarjhdownes`_ for the PR.

>* Allow collecting files with any file extension as Python modules (`2369`_).
>  Thanks `Kodiologist`_ for the PR.

>* Show the correct error message when collect &quot;parametrize&quot; func with wrong args (`2383`_).
>  Thanks `The-Compiler`_ for the report and `robin0371`_ for the PR.

>### 3.0.7

>==================


>* Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules silently discarding
>  other modules when importing fails
>  Notably, importing the ``anydbm`` module is fixed. (`2248`_).
>  Thanks `pfhayes`_ for the PR.

>* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occured twice per testcase
>  element in the XML report. Thanks `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with ``--pdb``
>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.

>* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`2238`_).
>  Thanks `sirex`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to `PEP-479`_ (`2160`_).
>  Thanks `tgoodlet`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fix internal errors when an unprintable ``AssertionError`` is raised inside a test.
>  Thanks `omerhadari`_ for the PR.

>* Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (`2231`_).
>  Thanks to `vidartf`_.

>* Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (`2281`_). Thanks `fbjorn`_ for the PR.

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
>  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
>  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks `barneygale`_ for the
>  PR.

>### 3.0.6

>==================

>* pytest no longer generates ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version ``3.0.5`` (`2118`_).
>  Thanks to `nicoddemus`_ for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (`2129`_).
>  Thanks to `malinoff`_ for the PR.

>* Plugins loaded by the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are now automatically
>  considered for assertion rewriting (`2185`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (`2150`_). The type(s) of the
>  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
>  error message. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR.

>* Fix ``pytester`` internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of
>  ``zope.interface`` (`1989`_). Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (`1920`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
>  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to `eli-b`_ for the PR.

>  Contributed by Jannis Leidel &amp; Ionel Cristian Mărieș in
>  `156 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/156&gt;`_.



>### 2.5.0

>------------------

>* Always show a summary when ``--cov-fail-under`` is used. Contributed by Francis Niu in `PR141
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/141&gt;`_.

It still needs a test for a website with no content-header and I would need a site with a larger downloadable file without a content-header to see how the spinner works.

I know it still needs work, but I would appreciate some input, if we should go ahead with it.

This will however change after awhile.

The regex for linux64 was the same as for linux32, so that if both builds are in one folder, linux32 is downloaded preferentially (probably cos it comes first in a list).

I specified the linux64 regex to avoid that problem.

This PR is for discussion only. It is just the easiest way of sharing ideas.

I set up two very basic tests for the DirectoryParser and for the ReleaseScraper (-p win32 -v latest).

Note that there is a basic unittest class setting up mozhttpd and terminating it, so we just need to inherit from it.

`downloadable_tests` is the folder that mimicks the Mozilla Server, so we can just add downloadable content into it.

The things I would like to have your input in is:
- Current binary is real and too big. What are alternatives to this?
- Is the general set up ok like this or do you see obvious disadvantages?
- What are meaningful tests?
- Comments on code is always welcome.

Thanks. I'm looking forward to your input :)

Hi,

I had this idea earlier today about adding a flag to let a download be directly installed in one go using mozinstall. I had to do this a couple of times before, so I thought it might be useful and I wanted to see if I can do it.

Let me know if it is useful.

NOTE: The flag is a bool, because I cannot pass optional string values with optparse. If we ever switch to argparse, I would by default try and use the directory of download, but leave the option of specifying a different directory open to the user.

Hi,

I had this idea earlier today about adding a flag to let a download be directly installed in one go using mozinstall. I had to do this a couple of times before, so I thought it might be useful and I wanted to see if I can do it.

Let me know if it is useful.

```
I just had a look at the TestManifest class of manifestparser.py and it's true it makes checks if a test exists, but unlike here, it just ignores it, if the test doesn't exist.

Also, if there is another while try/except block that I would have to create, it might be a good idea to think of something more general, as they tend to look very similar.

It works fine for this particular use, but I am unsure if it may break something elsewhere in the code. Everything else is pretty straight forward. The changes are summarised below.

thanks folks.

parser.py:
- added import urllib2
- changed line 21 to urllib2.urlopen(url, timeout=60)

scraper.py:
- added self.timeout attribute to Scraper class (default 600)
- added timeout=self.timeout param to line 194
- added a --timeout flag to CLI

Finding a build thus requires a more sophisticated algorithm than the one that _mozdownload_ currently uses. It isn't enough to find all dirs for the given day/channel and then pick the last one. _mozdownload_ must also filter the dirs by whether or not they contain an actual build.

Here's a branch that does that. Along the way, it fixes a recent regression that triggers an exception when checking if `tmp_file` is a file under certain circumstances in which `tmp_file` is undefined. And it enhances the directory parser to allow filtering by both regex and function.

Finding a build thus requires a more sophisticated algorithm than the one that _mozdownload_ currently uses. It isn't enough to find all dirs for the given day/channel and then pick the last one. _mozdownload_ must also filter the dirs by whether or not they contain an actual build.

Here's a branch that does that. Along the way, it fixes a recent regression that triggers an exception when checking if `tmp_file` is a file under certain circumstances in which `tmp_file` is undefined. And it enhances the directory parser to allow filtering by both regex and function.

Finding a build thus requires a more sophisticated algorithm than the one that _mozdownload_ currently uses. It isn't enough to find all dirs for the given day/channel and then pick the last one. _mozdownload_ must also filter the dirs by whether or not they contain an actual build.

Here's a branch that does that. Along the way, it fixes a recent regression that triggers an exception when checking if `tmp_file` is a file under certain circumstances in which `tmp_file` is undefined. And it enhances the directory parser to allow filtering by both regex and function.
