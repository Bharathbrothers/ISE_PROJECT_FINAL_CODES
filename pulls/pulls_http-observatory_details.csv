> Version 0.15.3
> --------------
> 
> Released 2019-05-14
> 
> -   Properly handle multi-line header folding in development server in
>     Python 2.7. (:issue:`1080`)
> -   Restore the ``response`` argument to :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized`.
>     (:pr:`1527`)
> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` doesn't add the ``WWW-Authenticate``
>     header if ``www_authenticate`` is not given. (:issue:`1516`)
> -   The default URL converter correctly encodes bytes to string rather
>     than representing them with ``b''``. (:issue:`1502`)
> -   Fix the filename format string in
>     :class:`~middleware.profiler.ProfilerMiddleware` to correctly handle
>     float values. (:issue:`1511`)
> -   Update :class:`~middleware.lint.LintMiddleware` to work on Python 3.
>     (:issue:`1510`)
> -   The debugger detects cycles in chained exceptions and does not time
>     out in that case. (:issue:`1536`)
> -   When running the development server in Docker, the debugger security
>     pin is now unique per container.
> 
> 
> Version 0.15.2
> --------------
> 
> Released 2019-04-02
> 
> -   ``Rule`` code generation uses a filename that coverage will ignore.
>     The previous value, ""generated"", was causing coverage to fail.
>     (:issue:`1487`)
> -   The test client removes the cookie header if there are no persisted
>     cookies. This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies
>     from the original request were used for redirects, causing functions
>     such as logout to fail. (:issue:`1491`)
> -   The test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to
>     prevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.
>     (:issue:`1498`)
> -   The ``""werkzeug""`` logger only adds a handler if there is no handler
>     configured for its level in the logging chain. This avoids double
>     logging if other code configures logging first. (:issue:`1492`)
> 
> 
> Version 0.15.1
> --------------
> 
> Released 2019-03-21
> 
> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` takes ``description`` as the first

As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

I'm not sure if -50 is the right score here, but any site using `<script src=""//` could end up loading a script from an HTTP origin, which we do penalize as -50, so I went with that by default, but ensured that loading external scripts insecurely still takes precedence in the score priority.

This includes new tests and updates existing tests to ensure that `src=""//` is detected as insecure in various scenarios.

There are a lot of requirements here that I wasn't able to resolve obviously to any code in the repository that's using it, though.

```Jinja2```: I don't see any instances of either ```{%``` or ```{{``` in this codebase.
```pycodestyle```: The webpage for this module says it used to be called ```pep8```, which is also listed. Nothing in the observatory calls it, though. Is this a travis-ci thing? It's not in ```.travis.yml```.
```pyflakes```: Same deal. Seems like travis-ci, but no invocation of it.
```Werkzeug```: Seems useful, but no occurrences of ```run_simple``` anywhere in the code.

So maybe some of these can be removed as part of separating these?
