As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

As promised, the FTP Migration team is following up from the 7/20 Monday Project Meeting where Sean Rich talked about a project that is underway to make our Product Delivery System better.


As a part of this project, we are migrating content out of our data centers to AWS. In addition to storage locations changing, namespaces will change and the FTP protocol for this system will be deprecated. If, after reading this email, you have any further questions, please email the team at ftpmigration@mozilla.com

tl;dr

Action:  The ftp protocol on ftp.mozilla.org is being turned off.

Timing:  Wednesday, 8/5/15.

Impacts:  

    After 8/5/15, ftp protocol support for ftp.mozilla.org will be completely disabled and downloads can only be accessed through http/https.  

    Users will no longer be able to just enter “ftp.mozilla.org” into their browser, because this action defaults to the ftp protocol.  Going forward, users should start using archive.mozilla.org.  The old name will still work but needs to be entered in your browser as https://ftp.mozilla.org.


Action:  The contents of ftp.mozilla.org are being migrated from the NetApp in PHX1 to AWS/S3 managed by Cloud Services.

Timing:  Migrating ftp.mozilla.org contents will start in late August and conclude by end of October.  Impacted teams will be notified of their migration date.

Impacts:

    Those teams that currently manually upload to these locations have been contacted and will be provided with S3 API keys.  They will be notified prior to their migration date and given a chance to validate their upload functionality post-migration.
    All existing download links will continue to work as they do now with no impact.
