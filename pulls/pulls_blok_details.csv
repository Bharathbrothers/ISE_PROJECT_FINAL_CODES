1,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/blok/pulls/227,227,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #226


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

9,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/blok/pulls/191,191,fix #150: remove ALL matching allowedHosts items,"I couldn't actually reproduce the original state of #150. I.e., I think it was caused by a previous bug in the add-on that added multiple items of the same host into the `allowedHosts` array. That bug has since been closed, but those of us (like @pdehaan) who had the add-on running before it was closed likely got into a state where we had multiple items of the same host in our `allowedHosts` array.

To fix, I wrapped the `allowedHosts.splice` call in a `do...while` loop to clear out **ALL** matching items from the `allowedHosts` array.

To test:
1. Run the add-on and disable protection for a few different sites.
2. Go back to at least one of the sites where you disabled protection, and re-enable it.

Verify:

Refresh each of the sites and verify that their protection state is what you expect. I.e., the disabled sites are still disabled, and the re-enabled site(s) is enabled.

7. Click the experiment, and click ""Enable""

To verify the broadcast channel is working:
1. Open the browser toolbox debugger
2. Place a breakpoint at `lib/webextension-channels.js:144` (`Metrics.onExperimentPing`)
3. In the browser, visit a site on which Blok blocks trackers (e.g., economist.com)
4. Click ""Disable blok""
   - When the page reloads, it should ask why you disabled blok
5. Click ""The page was broken""
6. You should see the browser toolbox debugger paused at the `Metrics.onExperimentPing` line - this means the disable reason message was successfully sent via the broadcast channel to the test pilot add-on to send a telemetry ping.

157,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/blok/pulls/14,14,for #6: web extension artifacts to enable test pilot experiment,"Recording testing steps here, as they are extensive, and I'm moving onto more issues.
1. Clone testpilot repo locally
   - For now, need to clone the [lmorchard/433-webextension-telemetry-2 fork/branch](https://github.com/lmorchard/testpilot/tree/433-webextension-telemetry-2)
2. Follow the [testpilot quickstart](https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot#quickstart) to set up http://testpilot.dev:8000
3. Open Firefox 48+ to http://testpilot.dev:8000 and click ""Install Test Pilot""
4. Go to http://testpilot.dev:8000/admin/experiments/experiment/add/ (user: admin, pass: admin)
5. Create an experiment for blok, the only specific values you need are:
   - xpi url: https://github.com/mozilla/blok/raw/master/web-ext-artifacts/blok-0.1.xpi
   - addon id: blok@mozilla.org
6. Go to http://testpilot.dev:8000/experiments
   - Should see the blok experiment
7. Click the experiment, and click ""Enable""

To verify the broadcast channel is working:
1. Open the browser toolbox debugger
2. Place a breakpoint at `lib/webextension-channels.js:144` (`Metrics.onExperimentPing`)
3. In the browser, visit a site on which Blok blocks trackers (e.g., economist.com)
4. Click ""Disable blok""
   - When the page reloads, it should ask why you disabled blok
5. Click ""The page was broken""
6. You should see the browser toolbox debugger paused at the `Metrics.onExperimentPing` line - this means the disable reason message was successfully sent via the broadcast channel to the test pilot add-on to send a telemetry ping.
