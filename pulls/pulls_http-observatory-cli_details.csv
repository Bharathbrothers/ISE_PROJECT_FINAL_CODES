0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/http-observatory-cli/pulls/15,15,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #14


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

1,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/http-observatory-cli/pulls/10,10,Fix #9 Timezone error when calculating age of scan,"Adds pytz as a dependency, this was necessary since datetime apparently does not contain any tzinfo instances and it is better than reinventing the wheel.

The problem was that apparently datetime.strptime does not create timezone-aware datetime objects even when %Z (timezone name) is used as part of the format string. datetime.now() without tzinfo parameter creates a timezone-naive datetime object as well but defaults to local time for the actual values instead of the more sensible UTC.

As a further suggestion for latter improvements I would suggest formatting the dates in the API as ISO8601 dates instead of the current ones which contain localized weekday and month names. I did not do this for now since i did not want to modify multiple components for this PR.
