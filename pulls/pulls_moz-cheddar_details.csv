3,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/moz-cheddar/pulls/4,4,Update to syntex 0.58.1.,"Update to the current version of syntex.  I hoped this would make it easier to fix the without-syntex nightly-only build, but it doesn't because syntex is currently incompatible with rustc nightly (https://github.com/serde-rs/syntex/issues/117), and may remain so now that syntex is maintainerless (https://github.com/serde-rs/syntex/issues/114).

I don't know if this PR helps with https://github.com/mozilla/moz-cheddar/issues/3 at all, but clearly moving to syn is the way forward.",kinetiknz,67343,2017-04-11T02:43:11Z,COLLABORATOR,True,23,20,4,UNMAINTAINED: A Rust crate for automatically generating C header files from Rust source file.
