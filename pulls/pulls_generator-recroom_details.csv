0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/generator-recroom/pulls/25,25,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"
As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

2,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/generator-recroom/pulls/23,23,Limit concurrent htmlmin to dist (fixes #14),"It looks like we want to limit to `htmlmin:dist` in the `concurrent:dist` task.

As it is now, in the build step, `htmlmin:deploy` is run when we call `concurrent:dist`.  If `htmlmin:deploy` is run before `usemin`, it won't replace all the scripts in index.html with the combined, minified versions. And we get 404s :(
