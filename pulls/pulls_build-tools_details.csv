1,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/build-tools/pulls/38,38,Remove dead code from tools repo,"This removes what I think is all the dead code (and no undead code!) from the tools repo. The goal here is to make it easier to see what actually matters, so we know what we need to relocate before getting rid of the repo. Most of what was removed was directly buildbot related (eg: manage-masters.py) or indirectly buildbot related (eg: hgtool.py). The things that remain are:
* Balrog submission library
* Update verify
* Final verify
* Signing server scripts + libs
* MINIDUMP_STACKWALK binaries
* gittool.py

Eg: the antivirus mozharness script uses extract_and_run_command.py, but we don't run it anymore.
