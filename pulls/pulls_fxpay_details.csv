```

This isn't strictly necessary for desktop payments but it splits fxpay into multiple files which will make it all much more manageable, especially as we add more code. Some notes:
- It takes a pseudo node-require approach to the modules.
- I changed names of some functions but those ones were never documented for public use: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Marketplace/Monetization/In-app_payments_section/fxPay_iap$edit
