0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/loci/pulls/36,36,chore(worker): update linting to match activity stream main repo,"Fixes #31 
More than 300 lines of linting, plus file updates to catch up with AS.

I copied back from AS some files that were not changed since the beginning (e.g.: ActionManager.js, most of the content pages).

This is the first step to migrate the worker queue back to AS.

URL normalization is being done at the Page/Task creation as I think it's better than proxying the message through some other method.

It hides the real error, so it makes debugging harder. I think it would be a good idea to update the AS Firefox version from time to time.
