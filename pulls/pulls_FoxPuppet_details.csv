<h2>6.0.1</h2>
<h1>pytest 6.0.1 (2020-07-30)</h1>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7394"">#7394</a>: Passing an empty <code>help</code> value to <code>Parser.add_option</code> is now accepted instead of crashing when running <code>pytest --help</code>.
Passing <code>None</code> raises a more informative <code>TypeError</code>.</li>
<li><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7558"">#7558</a>: Fix pylint <code>not-callable</code> lint on <code>pytest.mark.parametrize()</code> and the other builtin marks:
<code>skip</code>, <code>skipif</code>, <code>xfail</code>, <code>usefixtures</code>, <code>filterwarnings</code>.</li>
<li><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7559"">#7559</a>: Fix regression in plugins using <code>TestReport.longreprtext</code> (such as <code>pytest-html</code>) when <code>TestReport.longrepr</code> is not a string.</li>
<li><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7569"">#7569</a>: Fix logging capture handler's level not reset on teardown after a call to <code>caplog.set_level()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6.0.0</h2>
<h1>pytest 6.0.0 (2020-07-28)</h1>
<p>(<strong>Please see the full set of changes for this release also in the 6.0.0rc1 notes below</strong>)</p>
<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5584"">#5584</a>: <strong>PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.</strong></p>
<p>Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
possible, all warnings of type <code>PytestDeprecationWarning</code> now generate errors
instead of warning messages.</p>
<p><strong>The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 6.1</strong>, so please consult the
<a href=""https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html"">Deprecations and Removals</a>
section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.</p>
<p>In the pytest <code>6.0.X</code> series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a
stopgap measure by adding this to your <code>pytest.ini</code> file:</p>
<pre lang=""{.sourceCode"" data-meta="".ini}""><code>[pytest]
filterwarnings =
    ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning
</code></pre>
<p>But this will stop working when pytest <code>6.1</code> is released.</p>
<p><strong>If you have concerns</strong> about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
comment to <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5584"">#5584</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7472"">#7472</a>: The <code>exec_()</code> and <code>is_true()</code> methods of <code>_pytest._code.Frame</code> have been removed.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>Release v2020.5.28</h2>
<h1>2020.5.28 (2020-05-28)</h1>
<h2>Features &amp; Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>pipenv install</code> and <code>pipenv sync</code> will no longer attempt to install satisfied dependencies during installation. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3057"">#3057</a>, <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3506"">#3506</a></li>
<li>Added support for resolution of direct-url dependencies in <code>setup.py</code> files to respect <code>PEP-508</code> style URL dependencies. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3148"">#3148</a></li>
<li>Added full support for resolution of all dependency types including direct URLs, zip archives, tarballs, etc.
<ul>
<li>Improved error handling and formatting.</li>
<li>Introduced improved cross platform stream wrappers for better <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> consistency. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3298"">#3298</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For consistency with other commands and the <code>--dev</code> option description, <code>pipenv lock --requirements --dev</code> now emits both default and development dependencies. The new <code>--dev-only</code> option requests the previous behaviour (e.g. to generate a <code>dev-requirements.txt</code> file). <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3316"">#3316</a></li>
<li>Pipenv will now successfully recursively lock VCS sub-dependencies. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3328"">#3328</a></li>
<li>Added support for <code>--verbose</code> output to <code>pipenv run</code>. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3348"">#3348</a></li>
<li>Pipenv will now discover and resolve the intrinsic dependencies of <strong>all</strong> VCS dependencies, whether they are editable or not, to prevent resolution conflicts. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3368"">#3368</a></li>
<li>Added a new environment variable, <code>PIPENV_RESOLVE_VCS</code>, to toggle dependency resolution off for non-editable VCS, file, and URL based dependencies. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3577"">#3577</a></li>
<li>Added the ability for Windows users to enable emojis by setting <code>PIPENV_HIDE_EMOJIS=0</code>. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3595"">#3595</a></li>
<li>Allow overriding <code>PIPENV_INSTALL_TIMEOUT</code> environment variable (in seconds). <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3652"">#3652</a></li>
<li>Allow overriding <code>PIP_EXISTS_ACTION</code> evironment variable (value is passed to pip install). Possible values here: <a href=""https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip/#exists-action-option"">https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip/#exists-action-option</a> Useful when you need to <code>PIP\_EXISTS\_ACTION=i</code> (ignore existing packages) - great for CI environments, where you need really fast setup. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3738"">#3738</a></li>
<li>Pipenv will no longer forcibly override <code>PIP_NO_DEPS</code> on all vcs and file dependencies as resolution happens on these in a pre-lock step. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3763"">#3763</a></li>
<li>Improved verbose logging output during <code>pipenv lock</code> will now stream output to the console while maintaining a spinner. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3810"">#3810</a></li>
<li>Added support for automatic python installs via <code>asdf</code> and associated <code>PIPENV_DONT_USE_ASDF</code> environment variable. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4018"">#4018</a></li>
<li>Pyenv/asdf can now be used whether or not they are available on PATH. Setting <code>PYENV_ROOT</code>/<code>ASDF_DIR</code> in a <code>.env</code> file allows Pipenv to install an interpreter without any shell customizations, so long as pyenv/asdf is installed. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4245"">#4245</a></li>
<li>Added <code>--key</code> command line parameter for including personal PyUp.io API tokens when running <code>pipenv check</code>. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4257"">#4257</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Behavior Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make conservative checks of known exceptions when subprocess returns output, so user won't see the whole traceback - just the error. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2553"">#2553</a></li>
<li>Do not touch Pipfile early and rely on it so that one can do <code>pipenv sync</code> without a Pipfile. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3386"">#3386</a></li>
<li>Re-enable <code>--help</code> option for <code>pipenv run</code> command. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3844"">#3844</a></li>
<li>Make sure <code>pipenv lock -r --pypi-mirror {MIRROR_URL}</code> will respect the pypi-mirror in requirements output. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4199"">#4199</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Raise <code>PipenvUsageError</code> when [[source]] does not contain url field. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2373"">#2373</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused editable package resolution to sometimes fail with an unhelpful setuptools-related error message. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2722"">#2722</a></li>
<li>Fixed an issue which caused errors due to reliance on the system utilities <code>which</code> and <code>where</code> which may not always exist on some
systems.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused periodic failures in python discovery when executables named <code>python</code> were not present on the target <code>$PATH</code>. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2783"">#2783</a></li>
<li>Dependency resolution now writes hashes for local and remote files to the lockfile. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3053"">#3053</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented <code>pipenv graph</code> from correctly showing all dependencies when running from within <code>pipenv shell</code>. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3071"">#3071</a></li>
<li>Fixed resolution of direct-url dependencies in <code>setup.py</code> files to respect <code>PEP-508</code> style URL dependencies. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3148"">#3148</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused failures in warning reporting when running pipenv inside a virtualenv under some circumstances.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with package discovery when running <code>pipenv clean</code>. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3298"">#3298</a></li>
<li>Quote command arguments with carets (<code>^</code>) on Windows to work around unintended shell escapes. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3307"">#3307</a></li>
<li>Handle alternate names for UTF-8 encoding. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3313"">#3313</a></li>
<li>Abort pipenv before adding the non-exist package to Pipfile. <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3318"">#3318</a></li>

<blockquote>
<h2>5.4.1</h2>
<h1>pytest 5.4.1 (2020-03-13)</h1>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6909"">#6909</a>: Revert the change introduced by <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/6330"">#6330</a>, which required all arguments to <code>@pytest.mark.parametrize</code> to be explicitly defined in the function signature.</p>
<p>The intention of the original change was to remove what was expected to be an unintended/surprising behavior, but it turns out many people relied on it, so the restriction has been reverted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6910"">#6910</a>: Fix crash when plugins return an unknown stats while using the <code>--reportlog</code> option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>pytest 5.4.0 (2020-03-12)</h2>
<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6316"">#6316</a>: Matching of <code>-k EXPRESSION</code> to test names is now case-insensitive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6443"">#6443</a>: Plugins specified with <code>-p</code> are now loaded after internal plugins, which results in their hooks being called <em>before</em> the internal ones.</p>
<p>This makes the <code>-p</code> behavior consistent with <code>PYTEST_PLUGINS</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6637"">#6637</a>: Removed the long-deprecated <code>pytest_itemstart</code> hook.</p>
<p>This hook has been marked as deprecated and not been even called by pytest for over 10 years now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6673"">#6673</a>: Reversed / fix meaning of &quot;+/-&quot; in error diffs. &quot;-&quot; means that sth. expected is missing in the result and &quot;+&quot; means that there are unexpected extras in the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6737"">#6737</a>: The <code>cached_result</code> attribute of <code>FixtureDef</code> is now set to <code>None</code> when
the result is unavailable, instead of being deleted.</p>
<p>If your plugin performs checks like <code>hasattr(fixturedef, 'cached_result')</code>,
for example in a <code>pytest_fixture_post_finalizer</code> hook implementation, replace
it with <code>fixturedef.cached_result is not None</code>. If you <code>del</code> the attribute,
set it to <code>None</code> instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deprecations</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3238"">#3238</a>: Option <code>--no-print-logs</code> is deprecated and meant to be removed in a future release. If you use <code>--no-print-logs</code>, please try out <code>--show-capture</code> and
provide feedback.</p>
<p><code>--show-capture</code> command-line option was added in <code>pytest 3.5.0</code> and allows to specify how to
display captured output when tests fail: <code>no</code>, <code>stdout</code>, <code>stderr</code>, <code>log</code> or <code>all</code> (the default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/571"">#571</a>: Deprecate the unused/broken [pytest_collect_directory]{.title-ref} hook.
It was misaligned since the removal of the <code>Directory</code> collector in 2010
and incorrect/unusable as soon as collection was split from test execution.</p>
</li>

*Sourced from [flake8-docstrings's changelog](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8-docstrings/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).*

> 1.4.0
> =====
> 
> -   Add `--docstring-convention` option which allows selection of conventions besides the default `pep257`. Available options are based on those available from `pydocstyle` and are currently `pep257`, `google`, and `numpy`. `flake8-docstrings` also adds a special `all` docstring convention which will enable all rules from `pydocstyle`. Note that `pydocstyle` defines some conflicting rules so you'll want to use `ignore` / `extend-ignore` when selecting `docstring-convention = all`
> -   Bump minimum flake8 version to 3
> -   Fix proper handling of `stdin` via `--stdin-display-name`
> 
> 1.3.1
> =====
> 
> -   Fix incompatibility with pydocstyle 4.x

> pytest 5.0.1 (2019-07-04)
> =========================
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#5479](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479): Improve quoting in `raises` match failure message.
> -   [\#5523](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523): Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example `-vs`) in Python 3.8+.
> -   [\#5547](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547): `--step-wise` now handles `xfail(strict=True)` markers properly.
> 
> Improved Documentation
> ----------------------
> 
> -   [\#5517](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517): Improve ""Declaring new hooks"" section in chapter ""Writing Plugins""
>

> =========================
> 
> Important
> ---------
> 
> This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

> For more details, see our [Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html).
> 
> Removals
> --------
> 
> -   [\#1149](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149): Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example typing `pytest --doctest-mod` inplace of `--doctest-modules`. This was previously allowed where the `ArgumentParser` thought it was unambiguous, but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins. See for example issues [\#1149](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149), [\#3413](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413), and [\#4009](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009).
> -   [\#5402](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402): **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**
> 
>     Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as possible, all warnings of type `PytestDeprecationWarning` now generate errors instead of warning messages.
> 
>     **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the [Deprecations and Removals](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html) section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.
> 
>     In the pytest `5.0.X` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop gap measure by adding this to your `pytest.ini` file:

> -   [\#5412](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412): `ExceptionInfo` objects (returned by `pytest.raises`) now have the same `str` representation as `repr`, which avoids some confusion when users use `print(e)` to inspect the object.

> pytest 4.5.0 (2019-05-11)
> =========================
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   [\#4826](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4826): A warning is now emitted when unknown marks are used as a decorator. This is often due to a typo, which can lead to silently broken tests.
> -   [\#4907](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4907): Show XFail reason as part of JUnitXML message field.
> -   [\#5013](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5013): Messages from crash reports are displayed within test summaries now, truncated to the terminal width.
> -   [\#5023](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5023): New flag `--strict-markers` that triggers an error when unknown markers (e.g. those not registered using the [markers option]() in the configuration file) are used in the test suite.
> 
>     The existing `--strict` option has the same behavior currently, but can be augmented in the future for additional checks.
> 
> -   [\#5026](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5026): Assertion failure messages for sequences and dicts contain the number of different items now.
> -   [\#5034](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5034): Improve reporting with `--lf` and `--ff` (run-last-failure).
> -   [\#5035](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5035): The `--cache-show` option/action accepts an optional glob to show only matching cache entries.
> -   [\#5059](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5059): Standard input (stdin) can be given to pytester's `Testdir.run()` and `Testdir.popen()`.
> -   [\#5068](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5068): The `-r` option learnt about `A` to display all reports (including passed ones) in the short test summary.
> -   [\#5108](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5108): The short test summary is displayed after passes with output (`-rP`).
> -   [\#5172](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5172): The `--last-failed` (`--lf`) option got smarter and will now skip entire files if all tests of that test file have passed in previous runs, greatly speeding up collection.
> -   [\#5177](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5177): Introduce new specific warning `PytestWarning` subclasses to make it easier to filter warnings based on the class, rather than on the message. The new subclasses are:
>     -   `PytestAssertRewriteWarning`
>     -   `PytestCacheWarning`
>     -   `PytestCollectionWarning`
>     -   `PytestConfigWarning`
>     -   `PytestUnhandledCoroutineWarning`
>     -   `PytestUnknownMarkWarning`
> -   [\#5202](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5202): New `record_testsuite_property` session-scoped fixture allows users to log `<property>` tags at the `testsuite` level with the `junitxml` plugin.
> 
>     The generated XML is compatible with the latest xunit standard, contrary to the properties recorded by `record_property` and `record_xml_attribute`.
> 
> -   [\#5214](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5214): The default logging format has been changed to improve readability. Here is an example of a previous logging message:
> 
>         test_log_cli_enabled_disabled.py    3 CRITICAL critical message logged by test
> 
>     This has now become:
> 
>         CRITICAL root:test_log_cli_enabled_disabled.py:3 critical message logged by test
> 
>     The formatting can be changed through the [log\_format](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#confval-log_format) configuration option.
> 
> -   [\#5220](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5220): `--fixtures` now also shows fixture scope for scopes other than `""function""`.
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#5113](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5113): Deselected items from plugins using `pytest_collect_modifyitems` as a hookwrapper are correctly reported now.
> -   [\#5144](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5144): With usage errors `exitstatus` is set to `EXIT_USAGEERROR` in the `pytest_sessionfinish` hook now as expected.
> -   [\#5235](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5235): `outcome.exit` is not used with `EOF` in the pdb wrapper anymore, but only with `quit`.

> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#5089](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5089): Fix crash caused by error in `__repr__` function with both `showlocals` and verbose output enabled.

> -   [\#5171](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5171): Doc: `pytest_ignore_collect`, `pytest_collect_directory`, `pytest_collect_file` and `pytest_pycollect_makemodule` hooks's 'path' parameter documented type is now `py.path.local`

> -   [\#5092](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5092): Produce a warning when unknown keywords are passed to `pytest.param(...)`.

> 2.7.1 (2019-05-03)
> ==================
> 
> -   Fixed source distribution manifest so that garbage ain't included in the tarball.
> 
> 2.7.0 (2019-05-03)
> ==================
> 
> -   Fixed `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'configure_node'` error when `--no-cov` is used. Contributed by Alexander Shadchin in [\#263](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/263).
> -   Various testing and CI improvements. Contributed by Daniel Hahler in [\#255](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/255), [\#266](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/266), [\#272](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/272), [\#271](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/271) and [\#269](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/269).
> -   Improved documentation regarding subprocess and multiprocessing. Contributed in [\#265](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/265).
> -   Improved `pytest_cov.embed.cleanup_on_sigterm` to be reentrant (signal deliveries while signal handling is running won't break stuff).
> -   Added `pytest_cov.embed.cleanup_on_signal` for customized cleanup.
> -   Improved cleanup code and fixed various issues with leftover data files. All contributed in [\#265](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/265) or [\#262](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/262).
> -   Improved examples. Now there are two examples for the common project layouts, complete with working coverage configuration. The examples have CI testing. Contributed in [\#267](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/267).
> -   Improved help text for CLI options.

> pytest 4.4.0 (2019-03-29)
> =========================
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   [\#2224](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2224): `async` test functions are skipped and a warning is emitted when a suitable async plugin is not installed (such as `pytest-asyncio` or `pytest-trio`).
> 
>     Previously `async` functions would not execute at all but still be marked as ""passed"".
> 
> -   [\#2482](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2482): Include new `disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support` option to disable ascii-escaping in parametrized values. This may cause a series of problems and as the name makes clear, use at your own risk.
> -   [\#4718](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4718): The `-p` option can now be used to early-load plugins also by entry-point name, instead of just by module name.
> 
>     This makes it possible to early load external plugins like `pytest-cov` in the command-line:
> 
>         pytest -p pytest_cov
> 
> -   [\#4855](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4855): The `--pdbcls` option handles classes via module attributes now (e.g. `pdb:pdb.Pdb` with [pdb++]()), and its validation was improved.
> -   [\#4875](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4875): The [testpaths](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#confval-testpaths) configuration option is now displayed next to the `rootdir` and `inifile` lines in the pytest header if the option is in effect, i.e., directories or file names were not explicitly passed in the command line.
> 
>     Also, `inifile` is only displayed if there's a configuration file, instead of an empty `inifile:` string.
> 
> -   [\#4911](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4911): Doctests can be skipped now dynamically using `pytest.skip()`.
> -   [\#4920](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4920): Internal refactorings have been made in order to make the implementation of the [pytest-subtests](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-subtests) plugin possible, which adds unittest sub-test support and a new `subtests` fixture as discussed in [\#1367](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1367).
> 
>     For details on the internal refactorings, please see the details on the related PR.
> 
> -   [\#4931](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4931): pytester's `LineMatcher` asserts that the passed lines are a sequence.
> -   [\#4936](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4936): Handle `-p plug` after `-p no:plug`.
> 
>     This can be used to override a blocked plugin (e.g. in ""addopts"") from the command line etc.
> 
> -   [\#4951](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4951): Output capturing is handled correctly when only capturing via fixtures (capsys, capfs) with `pdb.set_trace()`.
> -   [\#4956](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4956): `pytester` sets `$HOME` and `$USERPROFILE` to the temporary directory during test runs.
> 
>     This ensures to not load configuration files from the real user's home directory.
> 
> -   [\#4980](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4980): Namespace packages are handled better with `monkeypatch.syspath_prepend` and `testdir.syspathinsert` (via `pkg_resources.fixup_namespace_packages`).
> -   [\#4993](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4993): The stepwise plugin reports status information now.
> -   [\#5008](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5008): If a `setup.cfg` file contains `[tool:pytest]` and also the no longer supported `[pytest]` section, pytest will use `[tool:pytest]` ignoring `[pytest]`. Previously it would unconditionally error out.
> 
>     This makes it simpler for plugins to support old pytest versions.
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#1895](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1895): Fix bug where fixtures requested dynamically via `request.getfixturevalue()` might be teardown before the requesting fixture.
> -   [\#4851](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4851): pytester unsets `PYTEST_ADDOPTS` now to not use outer options with `testdir.runpytest()`.
> -   [\#4903](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4903): Use the correct modified time for years after 2038 in rewritten `.pyc` files.
> -   [\#4928](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4928): Fix line offsets with `ScopeMismatch` errors.

37,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/FoxPuppet/pulls/253,253,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #252


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

> pytest 4.3.1 (2019-03-11)
> =========================
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#4810](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4810): Logging messages inside `pytest_runtest_logreport()` are now properly captured and displayed.
> -   [\#4861](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4861): Improve validation of contents written to captured output so it behaves the same as when capture is disabled.
> -   [\#4898](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4898): Fix `AttributeError: FixtureRequest has no 'confg' attribute` bug in `testdir.copy_example`.
> 
> Trivial/Internal Changes
> ------------------------
> 
> -   [\#4768](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4768): Avoid pkg\_resources import at the top-level.
> 
> pytest 4.3.0 (2019-02-16)
> =========================
> 
> Deprecations
> ------------
> 
> -   [\#4724](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4724): `pytest.warns()` now emits a warning when it receives unknown keyword arguments.
> 
>     This will be changed into an error in the future.
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   [\#2753](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2753): Usage errors from argparse are mapped to pytest's `UsageError`.
> -   [\#3711](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3711): Add the `--ignore-glob` parameter to exclude test-modules with Unix shell-style wildcards. Add the `collect_ignore_glob` for `conftest.py` to exclude test-modules with Unix shell-style wildcards.
> -   [\#4698](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4698): The warning about Python 2.7 and 3.4 not being supported in pytest 5.0 has been removed.
> 
>     In the end it was considered to be more of a nuisance than actual utility and users of those Python versions shouldn't have problems as `pip` will not install pytest 5.0 on those interpreters.
> 
> -   [\#4707](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4707): With the help of new `set_log_path()` method there is a way to set `log_file` paths from hooks.
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#4651](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4651): `--help` and `--version` are handled with `UsageError`.

> pytest 4.1.1 (2019-01-12)
> =========================
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> - `#2256 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2256>`_: Show full repr with ``assert a==b`` and ``-vv``.
> 
> 
> - `#3456 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3456>`_: Extend Doctest-modules to ignore mock objects.
> 
> 
> - `#4617 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4617>`_: Fixed ``pytest.warns`` bug when context manager is reused (e.g. multiple parametrization).
> 
> 
> - `#4631 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4631>`_: Don't rewrite assertion when ``__getattr__`` is broken
> 
> 
> 
> Improved Documentation
> ----------------------
> 
> - `#3375 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3375>`_: Document that using ``setup.cfg`` may crash other tools or cause hard to track down problems because it uses a different parser than ``pytest.ini`` or ``tox.ini`` files.
> 
> 
> 
> Trivial/Internal Changes
> ------------------------
> 
> - `#4602 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4602>`_: Uninstall ``hypothesis`` in regen tox env.
> 
> 
> pytest 4.1.0 (2019-01-05)
> =========================
> 
> Removals
> --------
> 
> - `#2169 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2169>`_: ``pytest.mark.parametrize``: in previous versions, errors raised by id functions were suppressed and changed into warnings. Now the exceptions are propagated, along with a pytest message informing the node, parameter value and index where the exception occurred.
> 
> 
> - `#3078 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3078>`_: Remove legacy internal warnings system: ``config.warn``, ``Node.warn``. The ``pytest_logwarning`` now issues a warning when implemented.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#config-warn-and-node-warn>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3079 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3079>`_: Removed support for yield tests - they are fundamentally broken because they don't support fixtures properly since collection and test execution were separated.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#yield-tests>`__ on information on how to update your code.

> Removals
> --------
> 
> - `#2169 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2169>`_: ``pytest.mark.parametrize``: in previous versions, errors raised by id functions were suppressed and changed into warnings. Now the exceptions are propagated, along with a pytest message informing the node, parameter value and index where the exception occurred.
> 
> 
> - `#3078 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3078>`_: Remove legacy internal warnings system: ``config.warn``, ``Node.warn``. The ``pytest_logwarning`` now issues a warning when implemented.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#config-warn-and-node-warn>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3079 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3079>`_: Removed support for yield tests - they are fundamentally broken because they don't support fixtures properly since collection and test execution were separated.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#yield-tests>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3082 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3082>`_: Removed support for applying marks directly to values in ``[**pytest**](https://github.com/pytest).mark.parametrize``. Use ``pytest.param`` instead.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#marks-in-pytest-mark-parametrize>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3083 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3083>`_: Removed ``Metafunc.addcall``. This was the predecessor mechanism to ``[**pytest**](https://github.com/pytest).mark.parametrize``.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#metafunc-addcall>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3085 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3085>`_: Removed support for passing strings to ``pytest.main``. Now, always pass a list of strings instead.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#passing-command-line-string-to-pytest-main>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3086 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3086>`_: ``[pytest]`` section in **setup.cfg** files is not longer supported, use ``[tool:pytest]`` instead. ``setup.cfg`` files
>   are meant for use with ``distutils``, and a section named ``pytest`` has notoriously been a source of conflicts and bugs.
> 
>   Note that for **pytest.ini** and **tox.ini** files the section remains ``[pytest]``.
> 
> 
> - `#3616 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3616>`_: Removed the deprecated compat properties for ``node.Class/Function/Module`` - use ``pytest.Class/Function/Module`` now.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#internal-classes-accessed-through-node>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#4421 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4421>`_: Removed the implementation of the ``pytest_namespace`` hook.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#pytest-namespace>`__ on information on how to update your code.

> pytest 4.0.0 (2018-11-13)
> =========================
> 
> Removals
> --------
> 
> - `#3737 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3737>`_: **RemovedInPytest4Warnings are now errors by default.**
> 
>   Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
>   possible, all warnings of type ``RemovedInPytest4Warnings`` now generate errors
>   instead of warning messages.
> 
>   **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 4.1**, so please consult the
>   `Deprecations and Removals <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html>`__
>   section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.
> 
>   In the pytest ``4.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
>   gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:
> 
>   .. code-block:: ini
> 
>       [pytest]
>       filterwarnings =
>           ignore::pytest.RemovedInPytest4Warning
> 
>   But this will stop working when pytest ``4.1`` is released.
> 
>   **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
>   comment to `#4348 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4348>`__.
> 
> 
> - `#4358 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4358>`_: Remove the ``::()`` notation to denote a test class instance in node ids.
> 
>   Previously, node ids that contain test instances would use ``::()`` to denote the instance like this::
> 
>       test_foo.py::Test::()::test_bar
> 
>   The extra ``::()`` was puzzling to most users and has been removed, so that the test id becomes now::
> 
>       test_foo.py::Test::test_bar
> 
>   This change could not accompany a deprecation period as is usual when user-facing functionality changes because
>   it was not really possible to detect when the functionality was being used explicitly.
> 
>   The extra ``::()`` might have been removed in some places internally already,
>   which then led to confusion in places where it was expected, e.g. with
>   ``--deselect`` (`#4127 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4127>`_).
> 
>   Test class instances are also not listed with ``--collect-only`` anymore.

> pytest 3.10.0 (2018-11-03)
> ==========================
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> - `#2619 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2619>`_: Resume capturing output after ``continue`` with ``__import__(""pdb"").set_trace()``.
> 
>   This also adds a new ``pytest_leave_pdb`` hook, and passes in ``pdb`` to the
>   existing ``pytest_enter_pdb`` hook.
> 
> 
> - `#4147 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4147>`_: Add ``--sw``, ``--stepwise`` as an alternative to ``--lf -x`` for stopping at the first failure, but starting the next test invocation from that test.  See `the documentation <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/cache.html#stepwise>`__ for more info.
> 
> 
> - `#4188 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4188>`_: Make ``--color`` emit colorful dots when not running in verbose mode. Earlier, it would only colorize the test-by-test output if ``--verbose`` was also passed.
> 
> 
> - `#4225 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4225>`_: Improve performance with collection reporting in non-quiet mode with terminals.
> 
>   The ""collecting …"" message is only printed/updated every 0.5s.
> 
> 
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> - `#2701 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2701>`_: Fix false ``RemovedInPytest4Warning: usage of Session... is deprecated, please use pytest`` warnings.
> 
> 
> - `#4046 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4046>`_: Fix problems with running tests in package ``__init__.py`` files.
> 
> 
> - `#4260 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4260>`_: Swallow warnings during anonymous compilation of source.
> 
> 
> - `#4262 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4262>`_: Fix access denied error when deleting stale directories created by ``tmpdir`` / ``tmp_path``.
> 
> 
> - `#611 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/611>`_: Naming a fixture ``request`` will now raise a warning: the ``request`` fixture is internal and
>   should not be overwritten as it will lead to internal errors.
> 
> - `#4266 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4266>`_: Handle (ignore) exceptions raised during collection, e.g. with Django's LazySettings proxy class.
> 
> 
> 
> Improved Documentation
> ----------------------
> 
> - `#4255 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4255>`_: Added missing documentation about the fact that module names passed to filter warnings are not regex-escaped.

> 2018.10.9 (2018-10-09)
> ======================
> 
> Features & Improvements
> -----------------------
> 
> -   Added environment variables PIPENV\_VERBOSE and PIPENV\_QUIET to
>     control output verbosity without needing to pass options. [#2527](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2527)
> -   Updated test-pypi addon to better support json-api access (forward
>     compatibility). Improved testing process for new contributors. [#2568](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2568)
> -   Greatly enhanced python discovery functionality:
>     -   Added `pep514` (windows launcher/finder) support for python
>         discovery.
>     -   Introduced architecture discovery for python installations which
>         support different architectures. [#2582](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2582)
> -   Added support for `pipenv shell` on msys and cygwin/mingw/git bash
>     for windows. [#2641](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2641)
> -   Enhanced resolution of editable and VCS dependencies. [#2643](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2643)
> -   Deduplicate and refactor CLI to use stateful arguments and object
>     passing. See [this issue](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pallets/click/issues/108) for reference. [#2814](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2814)
> 
> Behavior Changes
> ----------------
> 
> -   Virtual environment activation for `run` is revised to improve
>     interpolation with other Python discovery tools. [#2503](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2503)
> -   Improve terminal coloring to display better in Powershell. [#2511](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2511)
> -   Invoke `virtualenv` directly for virtual environment creation,
>     instead of depending on `pew`. [#2518](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2518)
> -   `pipenv --help` will now include short help descriptions. [#2542](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2542)
> -   Add `COMSPEC` to fallback option (along with `SHELL` and
>     `PYENV_SHELL`) if shell detection fails, improving robustness on
>     Windows. [#2651](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2651)
> -   Fallback to shell mode if run fails with Windows error 193 to handle
>     non-executable commands. This should improve usability on Windows,
>     where some users run non-executable files without specifying a
>     command, relying on Windows file association to choose the current
>     command. [#2718](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2718)
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   Fixed a bug which prevented installation of editable requirements
>     using `ssh://` style urls [#1393](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1393)
> -   VCS Refs for locked local editable dependencies will now update
>     appropriately to the latest hash when running `pipenv update`. [#1690](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1690)
> -   `.tar.gz` and `.zip` artifacts will now have dependencies installed

> pytest 3.8.2 (2018-10-02)
> =========================
> 
> Deprecations and Removals
> -------------------------
> 
> - `#4036 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4036>`_: The ``item`` parameter of ``pytest_warning_captured`` hook is now documented as deprecated. We realized only after
>   the ``3.8`` release that this parameter is incompatible with ``pytest-xdist``.
> 
>   Our policy is to not deprecate features during bugfix releases, but in this case we believe it makes sense as we are
>   only documenting it as deprecated, without issuing warnings which might potentially break test suites. This will get
>   the word out that hook implementers should not use this parameter at all.
> 
>   In a future release ``item`` will always be ``None`` and will emit a proper warning when a hook implementation
>   makes use of it.
> 
> 
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> - `#3539 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3539>`_: Fix reload on assertion rewritten modules.
> 
> 
> - `#4034 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4034>`_: The ``.user_properties`` attribute of ``TestReport`` objects is a list
>   of (name, value) tuples, but could sometimes be instantiated as a tuple
>   of tuples.  It is now always a list.
> 
> 
> - `#4039 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4039>`_: No longer issue warnings about using ``pytest_plugins`` in non-top-level directories when using ``--pyargs``: the
>   current ``--pyargs`` mechanism is not reliable and might give false negatives.
> 
> 
> - `#4040 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4040>`_: Exclude empty reports for passed tests when ``-rP`` option is used.
> 
> 
> - `#4051 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4051>`_: Improve error message when an invalid Python expression is passed to the ``-m`` option.
> 
> 
> - `#4056 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4056>`_: ``MonkeyPatch.setenv`` and ``MonkeyPatch.delenv`` issue a warning if the environment variable name is not ``str`` on Python 2.
> 
>   In Python 2, adding ``unicode`` keys to ``os.environ`` causes problems with ``subprocess`` (and possible other modules),
>   making this a subtle bug specially susceptible when used with ``from __future__ import unicode_literals``.
> 
> 
> 
> Improved Documentation
> ----------------------
> 
> - `#3928 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3928>`_: Add possible values for fixture scope to docs.

*Sourced from [pytest's changelog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst).*

> pytest 3.8.0 (2018-09-05)
> =========================
> 
> Deprecations and Removals
> -------------------------
> 
> - `#2452 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2452>`_: ``Config.warn`` has been deprecated, it should be replaced by calls to the standard ``warnings.warn``.
> 
>   ``Node.warn`` now supports two signatures:
> 
>   * ``node.warn(PytestWarning(""some message""))``: is now the recommended way to call this function. The warning
>     instance must be a ``PytestWarning`` or subclass  instance.
> 
>   * ``node.warn(""CI"", ""some message"")``: this code/message form is now deprecated and should be converted to
>     the warning instance form above.
> 
>   ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` and ``PytestExperimentalApiWarning`` are now part of the public API and should be accessed
>   using ``pytest.RemovedInPytest4Warning`` and ``pytest.PytestExperimentalApiWarning``.
> 
> 
> - `#3936 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3936>`_: ``[**pytest**](https://github.com/pytest).mark.filterwarnings`` second parameter is no longer regex-escaped,
>   making it possible to actually use regular expressions to check the warning message.
> 
>   **Note**: regex-escaping the match string was an implementation oversight that might break test suites which depend
>   on the old behavior.
> 
> 
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> - `#2452 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2452>`_: Internal pytest warnings are now issued using the standard ``warnings`` module, making it possible to use
>   the standard warnings filters to manage those warnings. This introduces ``PytestWarning``,
>   ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` and ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning types as part of the public API.
> 
>   Consult `the documentation <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html#internal-pytest-warnings>`_ for more info.
> 
> 
> - `#2908 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2908>`_: ``DeprecationWarning`` and ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are now shown by default if no other warning filter is
>   configured. This makes pytest more compliant with
>   `PEP-0506 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0565/#recommended-filter-settings-for-test-runners>`_. See
>   `the docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html#deprecationwarning-and-pendingdeprecationwarning>`_ for
>   more info.
> 
> 
> - `#3251 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3251>`_: Warnings are now captured and displayed during test collection.
> 
> 
> - `#3784 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3784>`_: ``PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD`` environment variable disables plugin auto-loading when set.

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **3.6.3** to **3.6.4**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.6.4
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Invoke pytest using ``-mpytest`` so ``sys.path`` does not get polluted by packages installed in ``site-packages``. (`742 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/742&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Use ``smtp_connection`` instead of ``smtp`` in fixtures documentation to avoid possible confusion. (`3592 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3592&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Remove obsolete ``__future__`` imports. (`2319 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2319&gt;`_)

- Add CITATION to provide information on how to formally cite pytest. (`3402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3402&gt;`_)

- Replace broken type annotations with type comments. (`3635 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3635&gt;`_)

- Pin ``pluggy`` to ``&lt;0.8``. (`3727 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3727&gt;`_)

   ### 2018.7.1
   ```
   =====================

Features &amp; Improvements
-----------------------

- All calls to ``pipenv shell`` are now implemented from the ground up using `shellingham  &lt;https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham&gt;`_, a custom library which was purpose built to handle edge cases and shell detection.  `2371 &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2371&gt;`_

### Update [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv) from **2018.5.18** to **2018.6.25**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2018.6.25
   ```
   - Added error handling functionality to properly cope with single-digit `Requires-Python` metatdata with no specifiers.
 - Pipenv will now generate hashes much more quickly by resolving them in a single pass during locking.
 - `pipenv run` will now avoid spawning additional `COMSPEC` instances to run commands in when possible.
 - `pipenv check` now may take multiple of the additional argument `--ignore` which takes a parameter `cve_id` for the purpose of ignoring specific CVEs.
 - Patched `python-dotenv` to ensure that environment variables always get encoded to the filesystem encoding.
 - Virtualenv names will now appear in prompts for most Windows users.
 - Resolver runtime and caching has been improved.
 - Improved virtualenv discovery when using `pipenv --venv`.
 - Improved error messages when failing to activate virtualenvs.
 - Dependency resolver reliability has been improved.
 - Added nested JSON output to the `pipenv graph` command.
 - Added support for mounted drives via UNC paths.
 - Added support for Windows Subsystem for Linux bash shell detection.
 - Added custom shell detection library `shellingham`, a port of our changes to `pew`.
 - Requirements are only auto-imported in new projects created without passing any packages
   to install and without an initial Pipfile.
 - Added support for cmder shell paths with spaces.
 - Dropped vendored pip 9 and vendor, patch, and migrate to pip 10.
 - Virtualenv activation lines will now avoid being written to some shell history files.
 - Pipenv-created virtualenvs will now be associated with a `.project` folder (features can
   be implemented on top of this later or users may choose to use `pipenv-pipes` to take
   full advantage of this.)
 - Lock and update VCS dependencies properly by checking them out and cloning them
   manually before installing and generating a lockfile to guarantee dependencies are
   locked.
 - PyPI mirror URLs can now be set to override instances of PyPI urls by passing the
   `--pypi-mirror` argument from the command line or setting the `PIPENV_PYPI_MIRROR`
   environment variable.

### Update [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv) from **2018.5.18** to **2018.6.25**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 2018.6.25
   ```
   - Added error handling functionality to properly cope with single-digit `Requires-Python` metatdata with no specifiers.
 - Pipenv will now generate hashes much more quickly by resolving them in a single pass during locking.
 - `pipenv run` will now avoid spawning additional `COMSPEC` instances to run commands in when possible.
 - `pipenv check` now may take multiple of the additional argument `--ignore` which takes a parameter `cve_id` for the purpose of ignoring specific CVEs.
 - Patched `python-dotenv` to ensure that environment variables always get encoded to the filesystem encoding.
 - Virtualenv names will now appear in prompts for most Windows users.
 - Resolver runtime and caching has been improved.
 - Improved virtualenv discovery when using `pipenv --venv`.
 - Improved error messages when failing to activate virtualenvs.
 - Dependency resolver reliability has been improved.
 - Added nested JSON output to the `pipenv graph` command.
 - Added support for mounted drives via UNC paths.
 - Added support for Windows Subsystem for Linux bash shell detection.
 - Added custom shell detection library `shellingham`, a port of our changes to `pew`.
 - Requirements are only auto-imported in new projects created without passing any packages
   to install and without an initial Pipfile.
 - Added support for cmder shell paths with spaces.
 - Dropped vendored pip 9 and vendor, patch, and migrate to pip 10.
 - Virtualenv activation lines will now avoid being written to some shell history files.
 - Pipenv-created virtualenvs will now be associated with a `.project` folder (features can
   be implemented on top of this later or users may choose to use `pipenv-pipes` to take
   full advantage of this.)
 - Lock and update VCS dependencies properly by checking them out and cloning them
   manually before installing and generating a lockfile to guarantee dependencies are
   locked.
 - PyPI mirror URLs can now be set to override instances of PyPI urls by passing the
   `--pypi-mirror` argument from the command line or setting the `PIPENV_PYPI_MIRROR`
   environment variable.
 - Locking will now pin the correct VCS ref during `pipenv update` runs.
 - Running `pipenv update` with a new vcs ref specified in the `Pipfile` will now properly
   obtain, resolve, and install the specified dependency at the specified ref.
 - Pipenv will now parse &amp; capitalize`platform_python_implementation` markers -- **note** this

   ### 3.6.0
   ```
   =========================

Features
--------

- Revamp the internals of the ``pytest.mark`` implementation with correct per
  node handling which fixes a number of long standing bugs caused by the old
  design. This introduces new ``Node.iter_markers(name)`` and
  ``Node.get_closest_mark(name)`` APIs. Users are **strongly encouraged** to
  read the `reasons for the revamp in the docs
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.htmlmarker-revamp-and-iteration&gt;`_,
  or jump over to details about `updating existing code to use the new APIs
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.htmlupdating-code&gt;`_. (`3317
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3317&gt;`_)

- Now when ``pytest.fixture`` is applied more than once to the same function a
  ``ValueError`` is raised. This buggy behavior would cause surprising problems
  and if was working for a test suite it was mostly by accident. (`2334
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2334&gt;`_)

- Support for Python 3.7&#39;s builtin ``breakpoint()`` method, see `Using the
  builtin breakpoint function
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlbreakpoint-builtin&gt;`_ for
  details. (`3180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3180&gt;`_)

- ``monkeypatch`` now supports a ``context()`` function which acts as a context
  manager which undoes all patching done within the ``with`` block. (`3290
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3290&gt;`_)

- The ``--pdb`` option now causes KeyboardInterrupt to enter the debugger,
  instead of stopping the test session. On python 2.7, hitting CTRL+C again
  exits the debugger. On python 3.2 and higher, use CTRL+D. (`3299
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3299&gt;`_)

- pytest not longer changes the log level of the root logger when the
  ``log-level`` parameter has greater numeric value than that of the level of
  the root logger, which makes it play better with custom logging configuration
  in user code. (`3307 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3307&gt;`_)


Bug Fixes
---------

- A rare race-condition which might result in corrupted ``.pyc`` files on
  Windows has been hopefully solved. (`3008
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3008&gt;`_)

- Also use iter_marker for discovering the marks applying for marker
  expressions from the cli to avoid the bad data from the legacy mark storage.
  (`3441 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3441&gt;`_)

- When showing diffs of failed assertions where the contents contain only
  whitespace, escape them using ``repr()`` first to make it easy to spot the
  differences. (`3443 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3443&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Change documentation copyright year to a range which auto-updates itself each
  time it is published. (`3303
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3303&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- ``pytest`` now depends on the `python-atomicwrites
  &lt;https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites&gt;`_ library. (`3008
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3008&gt;`_)

- Update all pypi.python.org URLs to pypi.org. (`3431
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3431&gt;`_)

- Detect `pytest_` prefixed hooks using the internal plugin manager since
  ``pluggy`` is deprecating the ``implprefix`` argument to ``PluginManager``.
  (`3487 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3487&gt;`_)

- Import ``Mapping`` and ``Sequence`` from ``_pytest.compat`` instead of
  directly from ``collections`` in ``python_api.py::approx``. Add ``Mapping``
  to ``_pytest.compat``, import it from ``collections`` on python 2, but from
  ``collections.abc`` on Python 3 to avoid a ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python
  3.7 or newer. (`3497 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3497&gt;`_)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.4.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Move import of ``doctest.UnexpectedException`` to top-level to avoid possible
>  errors when using ``--pdb``. (`1810
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1810&gt;`_)

>- Added printing of captured stdout/stderr before entering pdb, and improved a
>  test which was giving false negatives about output capturing. (`3052
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3052&gt;`_)

>- Fix ordering of tests using parametrized fixtures which can lead to fixtures
>  being created more than necessary. (`3161
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3161&gt;`_)

>- Fix bug where logging happening at hooks outside of &quot;test run&quot; hooks would
>  cause an internal error. (`3184
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3184&gt;`_)

>- Detect arguments injected by ``unittest.mock.patch`` decorator correctly when
>  pypi ``mock.patch`` is installed and imported. (`3206
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3206&gt;`_)

>- Errors shown when a ``pytest.raises()`` with ``match=`` fails are now cleaner
>  on what happened: When no exception was raised, the &quot;matching &#39;...&#39;&quot; part got
>  removed as it falsely implies that an exception was raised but it didn&#39;t
>  match. When a wrong exception was raised, it&#39;s now thrown (like
>  ``pytest.raised()`` without ``match=`` would) instead of complaining about
>  the unmatched text. (`3222
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3222&gt;`_)

>- Fixed output capture handling in doctests on macOS. (`985
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/985&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Add Sphinx parameter docs for ``match`` and ``message`` args to
>  ``pytest.raises``. (`3202
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3202&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes

>- pytest has changed the publication procedure and is now being published to
>  PyPI directly from Travis. (`3060
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3060&gt;`_)

>  order to comply with the naming convention. (`3166

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.4.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- All pytest classes now subclass ``object`` for better Python 2/3 compatibility.
>  This should not affect user code except in very rare edge cases. (`2147
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147&gt;`_)


>Features
>--------

>- Introduce ``empty_parameter_set_mark`` ini option to select which mark to
>  apply when ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` is given an empty set of parameters.
>  Valid options are ``skip`` (default) and ``xfail``. Note that it is planned
>  to change the default to ``xfail`` in future releases as this is considered
>  less error prone. (`2527
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2527&gt;`_)

>- **Incompatible change**: after community feedback the `logging
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_ functionality has
>  undergone some changes. Please consult the `logging documentation
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.htmlincompatible-changes-in-pytest-3-4&gt;`_
>  for details. (`3013 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3013&gt;`_)

>- Console output falls back to &quot;classic&quot; mode when capturing is disabled (``-s``),
>  otherwise the output gets garbled to the point of being useless. (`3038
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3038&gt;`_)

>- New `pytest_runtest_logfinish
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_logfinish&gt;`_
>  hook which is called when a test item has finished executing, analogous to
>  `pytest_runtest_logstart
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_start&gt;`_.
>  (`3101 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3101&gt;`_)

>- Improve performance when collecting tests using many fixtures. (`3107
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3107&gt;`_)

>- New ``caplog.get_records(when)`` method which provides access to the captured
>  records for the ``&quot;setup&quot;``, ``&quot;call&quot;`` and ``&quot;teardown&quot;``
>  testing stages. (`3117 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3117&gt;`_)

>- New fixture ``record_xml_attribute`` that allows modifying and inserting
>  attributes on the ``&lt;testcase&gt;`` xml node in JUnit reports. (`3130
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3130&gt;`_)

>- The default cache directory has been renamed from ``.cache`` to
>  ``.pytest_cache`` after community feedback that the name ``.cache`` did not
>  make it clear that it was used by pytest. (`3138
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3138&gt;`_)

>- Colorize the levelname column in the live-log output. (`3142
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3142&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix hanging pexpect test on MacOS by using flush() instead of wait().
>  (`2022 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2022&gt;`_)

>- Fix restoring Python state after in-process pytest runs with the
>  ``pytester`` plugin; this may break tests using multiple inprocess
>  pytest runs if later ones depend on earlier ones leaking global interpreter
>  changes. (`3016 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3016&gt;`_)

>- Fix skipping plugin reporting hook when test aborted before plugin setup
>  hook. (`3074 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3074&gt;`_)

>- Fix progress percentage reported when tests fail during teardown. (`3088
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3088&gt;`_)

>- **Incompatible change**: ``-o/--override`` option no longer eats all the
>  remaining options, which can lead to surprising behavior: for example,
>  ``pytest -o foo=1 /path/to/test.py`` would fail because ``/path/to/test.py``
>  would be considered as part of the ``-o`` command-line argument. One
>  consequence of this is that now multiple configuration overrides need
>  multiple ``-o`` flags: ``pytest -o foo=1 -o bar=2``. (`3103
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3103&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Document hooks (defined with ``historic=True``) which cannot be used with
>  ``hookwrapper=True``. (`2423
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2423&gt;`_)

>- Clarify that warning capturing doesn&#39;t change the warning filter by default.
>  (`2457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2457&gt;`_)

>- Clarify a possible confusion when using pytest_fixture_setup with fixture
>  functions that return None. (`2698
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2698&gt;`_)

>- Fix the wording of a sentence on doctest flags used in pytest. (`3076
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3076&gt;`_)

>- Prefer ``https://*.readthedocs.io`` over ``http://*.rtfd.org`` for links in
>  the documentation. (`3092
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3092&gt;`_)

>- Improve readability (wording, grammar) of Getting Started guide (`3131
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3131&gt;`_)

>- Added note that calling pytest.main multiple times from the same process is
>  not recommended because of import caching. (`3143
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3143&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Show a simple and easy error when keyword expressions trigger a syntax error
>  (for example, ``&quot;-k foo and import&quot;`` will show an error that you can not use
>  the ``import`` keyword in expressions). (`2953
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2953&gt;`_)

>- Change parametrized automatic test id generation to use the ``__name__``
>  attribute of functions instead of the fallback argument name plus counter.
>  (`2976 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2976&gt;`_)

>- Replace py.std with stdlib imports. (`3067
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3067&gt;`_)

>- Corrected &#39;you&#39; to &#39;your&#39; in logging docs. (`3129
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3129&gt;`_)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.3.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions
>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on
>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we
>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users
>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)

>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the
>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2236
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2236&gt;`_)

>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken
>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal
>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)

>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack
>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)

>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it
>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>Features
>--------

>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``
>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available
>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and
>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``
>  declarations on functions. (`2267
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)

>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)

>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The
>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``
>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)

>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)

>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.
>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options
>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using
>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test
>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).
>  For more information, please see the `logging docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was
>  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog
>  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch
>  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the
>  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has
>  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)

>- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the
>  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)

>- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)

>- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and
>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2923
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2923&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2934
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2934&gt;`_)

>- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with
>  ``--doctest-modules``. (`502
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/502&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.
>  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)

>- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now
>  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the
>  original traceback. In python2 it will show the original traceback with a new
>  message that explains in which plugin. In python3 it will show 2 canonized
>  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an
>  exception that PyTest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)

>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)

>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to
>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)

>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its
>  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``
>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and
>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)

>- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being
>  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,
>  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation
>  for safety. (`2809 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2809&gt;`_)

>- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from
>  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (`2845
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2845&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which
>  should not be rewritten. (`2939
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2939&gt;`_)

>- Handle marks without description in ``pytest.ini``. (`2942

### Changelog

>### 3.1.3

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix decode error in Python 2 for doctests in docstrings. (`2434
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2434&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised during teardown by finalizers are now suppressed until all
>  finalizers are called, with the initial exception reraised. (`2440
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2440&gt;`_)

>- Fix incorrect &quot;collected items&quot; report when specifying tests on the command-
>  line. (`2464 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2464&gt;`_)

>- ``deprecated_call`` in context-manager form now captures deprecation warnings
>  even if the same warning has already been raised. Also, ``deprecated_call``
>  will always produce the same error message (previously it would produce
>  different messages in context-manager vs. function-call mode). (`2469

>- Explicitly state for which hooks the calls stop after the first non-None
>  result. (`2493 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2493&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Create invoke tasks for updating the vendored packages. (`2474
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2474&gt;`_)

>- Update copyright dates in LICENSE, README.rst and in the documentation.

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.1.3

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix decode error in Python 2 for doctests in docstrings. (`2434
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2434&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised during teardown by finalizers are now suppressed until all
>  finalizers are called, with the initial exception reraised. (`2440
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2440&gt;`_)

>- Fix incorrect &quot;collected items&quot; report when specifying tests on the command-
>  line. (`2464 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2464&gt;`_)

>- ``deprecated_call`` in context-manager form now captures deprecation warnings
>  even if the same warning has already been raised. Also, ``deprecated_call``
>  will always produce the same error message (previously it would produce
>  different messages in context-manager vs. function-call mode). (`2469
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2469&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue where paths collected by pytest could have triple leading ``/``
>  characters. (`2475 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2475&gt;`_)

>- Fix internal error when trying to detect the start of a recursive traceback.
>  (`2486 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2486&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly state for which hooks the calls stop after the first non-None
>  result. (`2493 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2493&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Create invoke tasks for updating the vendored packages. (`2474
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2474&gt;`_)

>- Update copyright dates in LICENSE, README.rst and in the documentation.
>  (`2499 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2499&gt;`_)

>=========================

>Bug Fixes

>- Respect ``python_files`` in assertion rewriting. (2121)

>- Fix recursion error detection when frames in the traceback contain objects

>- ``UnicodeWarning`` is issued from the internal pytest warnings plugin only
>  when the message contains non-ascii unicode (Python 2 only). (2463)

>- Added a workaround for Python 3.6 WindowsConsoleIO breaking due to Pytests&#39;s
>  FDCapture. Other code using console handles might still be affected by the
>  very same issue and might require further workarounds/fixes, i.e. colorama.
>  (2467)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Fix internal API links to ``pluggy`` objects. (2331)

>- Make it clear that ``pytest.xfail`` stops test execution at the calling point
>  and improve overall flow of the ``skipping`` docs. (810)

### Changelog
> 
>### 2.17.3

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Improvements**

>- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.




>### 2.17.2

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Improvements**

>- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.




>### 2.17.1

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Improvements**

>- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.




>### 2.17.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Improvements**

>- Removal of the 301 redirect cache. This improves thread-safety.




>### 2.16.5

>+++++++++++++++++++

>- Improvements to ``$ python -m requests.help``.



>### 2.16.4

>+++++++++++++++++++

>- Introduction of the ``$ python -m requests.help`` command, for debugging with maintainers!



>### 2.16.3

>+++++++++++++++++++

>- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.



>### 2.16.2

>+++++++++++++++++++

>- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.

>No code modification (noted below) should be neccessary any longer.



>### 2.16.1

>+++++++++++++++++++

>- Restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
>- Bugfix for ``urllib3`` version parsing.

>**Note**: code that was written to import against the ``requests.packages``
>namespace previously will have to import code that rests at this module-level
>now.

>For example::

>    from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

>Will need to be re-written to be::

>    from requests.packages import urllib3
>    urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager

>Or, even better::

>    from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager



>### 2.16.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>- Unvendor ALL the things!



>### 2.15.1

>+++++++++++++++++++

>- Everyone makes mistakes.



>### 2.15.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Improvements**

>- Introduction of the ``Response.next`` property, for getting the next
>  ``PreparedResponse`` from a redirect chain (when ``allow_redirects=False``).
>- Internal refactoring of ``__version__`` module.

>**Bugfixes**

>- Restored once-optional parameter for ``requests.utils.get_environ_proxies()``.



>### 2.14.2

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency markers to
>  widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.



>### 2.14.1

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip
>  releases.



>### 2.14.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Improvements**

>- It is now possible to pass ``no_proxy`` as a key to the ``proxies``
>  dictionary to provide handling similar to the ``NO_PROXY`` environment
>  variable.
>- When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories
>  Requests now raises ``IOError``, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS
>  request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.
>- The behavior of ``SessionRedirectMixin`` was slightly altered.
>  ``resolve_redirects`` will now detect a redirect by calling
>  ``get_redirect_target(response)`` instead of directly
>  querying ``Response.is_redirect`` and ``Response.headers[&#39;location&#39;]``.
>  Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
>- Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have higher
>  resolution on Windows.
>- Added ``win_inet_pton`` as conditional dependency for the ``[socks]`` extra
>  on Windows with Python 2.7.
>- Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
>  check doesn&#39;t use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
>- URLs with schemes that begin with ``http`` but are not ``http`` or ``https``
>  no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

>**Bugfixes**

>- Much improved handling of non-ASCII ``Location`` header values in redirects.
>  Fewer ``UnicodeDecodeErrors`` are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now
>  correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.
>- If an attempt to ``seek`` file to find out its length fails, we now
>  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.
>- Restricted ``HTTPDigestAuth`` to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX
>  responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
>- Fixed some code that was firing ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python 3.6.
>- The dismayed person emoticon (``/o\\``) no longer has a big head. I&#39;m sure
>  this is what you were all worrying about most.


>**Miscellaneous**

>- Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
>- Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
>- Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
>- Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.



>### 2.13.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Features**

>- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
>  save some memory for users.

>**Miscellaneous**

>- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
>- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.

There's a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.
You are currently using **3.1.0**. I have updated it to **3.1.1**



These links might come in handy:  <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest"">PyPI</a> | <a href=""https://pyup.io/changelogs/pytest/"">Changelog</a> | <a href=""https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues"">Repo</a> | <a href=""http://pytest.org"">Homepage</a> 



### Changelog
> 
>### 3.1.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
>  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
>  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
>  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (2430)

>- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (2434)

>- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (2436)

>- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
>  context manager form. (2441)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (2390)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.7

>==================


>* Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules silently discarding
>  other modules when importing fails
>  Notably, importing the `anydbm` module is fixed. (`2248`_).
>  Thanks `pfhayes`_ for the PR.

>* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occured twice per testcase
>  element in the XML report. Thanks `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with ``--pdb``
>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.
>  
>* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`2238`_).
>  Thanks `sirex`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to `PEP-479`_ (`2160`_).

>

>* Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (`2231`_).
>  Thanks to `vidartf`_.

>* Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (`2281`_). Thanks `fbjorn`_ for the PR.

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
>  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
>  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks `barneygale`_ for the
>  PR.

You are currently using **1.7.0**. I have updated it to **1.8.0**

### Changelog
> 
>### 1.8.0


>* **BREAKING CHANGE:** Moved cloud testing provider credentials into separate
>  files for improved security.

>  * If you are using the environment variables for specifying cloud testing
>    provider credentials, then you will not be affected.
>  * If you are storing credentials from any of the cloud testing providers in
>    one of the default configuration files then they will no longer be used.
>    These files are often checked into source code repositories, so it was
>    previously very easy to accidentally expose your credentials.
>  * Each cloud provider now has their own configuration file, such as
>    ``.browserstack``, ``.crossbrowsertesting``, ``.saucelabs``,
>    ``.testingbot`` and these can be located in the working directory or in the
>    user&#39;s home directory. This provides a convenient way to set up these files
>    globally, and override them for individual projects.
>  * To migrate, check ``pytest.ini``, ``tox.ini``, and ``setup.cfg`` for any
>    keys starting with ``browserstack_``, ``crossbrowsertesting_``,
>    ``saucelabs_``, or ``testingbot_``. If you find any, create a new
>    configuration file for the appropriate cloud testing provider with your
>    credentials, and remove the entries from the original file.
>  * The configuration keys can differ between cloud testing providers, so
>    please check the :doc:`user_guide` for details.
>  * See `60 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-selenium/issues/60&gt;`_ for
>    for original issue and related patch.

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.6.dev0

>=======================

>* pytest no longer generates ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version ``3.0.5`` (`2118`_).
>  Thanks to `nicoddemus`_ for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.



>* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (`2129`_).
>  Thanks to `malinoff`_ for the PR.

>* Plugins loaded by the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are now automatically
>  considered for assertion rewriting (`2185`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (`2150`_). The type(s) of the
>  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
>  error message. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR.

>* Fix ``pytester`` internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of
>  ``zope.interface`` (`1989`_). Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (`1920`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
>  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to `eli-b`_ for the PR.
