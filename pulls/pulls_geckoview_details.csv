<h2>v1.11.0 / 2021-01-03</h2>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<h4>Faster, more reliable installation: Native Gems for Linux and OSX/Darwin</h4>
<p>&quot;Native gems&quot; contain pre-compiled libraries for a specific machine architecture. On supported platforms, this removes the need for compiling the C extension and the packaged libraries. This results in <strong>much faster installation</strong> and <strong>more reliable installation</strong>, which as you probably know are the biggest headaches for Nokogiri users.</p>
<p>We've been shipping native Windows gems since 2009, but starting in v1.11.0 we are also shipping native gems for these platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux: <code>x86-linux</code> and <code>x86_64-linux</code> -- including musl platforms like alpine</li>
<li>OSX/Darwin: <code>x86_64-darwin</code> and <code>arm64-darwin</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We'd appreciate your thoughts and feedback on this work at <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2075"">#2075</a>.</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<h4>Ruby</h4>
<p>This release introduces support for Ruby 2.7 and 3.0 in the precompiled native gems.</p>
<p>This release ends support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby 2.3, for which <a href=""https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/03/31/support-of-ruby-2-3-has-ended/"">official support ended on 2019-03-31</a> [<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1886"">#1886</a>] (Thanks <a href=""https://github.com/ashmaroli""><code>@ashmaroli</code></a>!)</li>

If you can think of a way of getting hold of these screenshots without creating a new Bugzilla identity then please let me know. Missing screenshots can be found in `ContributingToMC.md` and are identifed by `<Screenshot Needed>` so it doesn't appear in the rendered markdown.

Also missing is the section detailling the `try` syntax needed for a `try` submission for GeckoView in `GeckoViewQuickStart.md`. This is because I don't yet know what the correct syntax is. I will update when I have found it out.

Please let me know if you can follow this guide. I have run through it on both a Mac and an Ubuntu box myself but I might have missed an error due to already having installed a vital dependency.

The guide starts at `GeckoViewQuickStart.md` which provides links through to `MozCentralQuickStart.md` and `ContributingtoMC.md`.
