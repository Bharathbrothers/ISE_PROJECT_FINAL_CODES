0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/aframe-xr/pulls/25,25,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #24


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

To make it clearer that there are 3 scripts to include"
24,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/aframe-xr/pulls/11,11,To make it clearer that there are 3 scripts to include,"Hi. The README currently says: `Include three.xr.js & aframe-xr after A-frame...`. But the code example currently looks like this:

```
<script src=""../../../vendor/aframe-master.js""></script>
<script src='aframe-xr.js'></script>
```

So I thought I just needed to include `aframe-master.js` and `aframe-xr.js`.

Also, taking a look at the [xr-basic example](https://github.com/mozilla/aframe-xr/blob/master/examples/xr/basic/index.html) caused me some temporary further confusion, because the `aframe-master.js` script tag is off-screen, over the right-hand side, after the origin trial tag.

So this PR is my recommendation for extra newbie-friendliness:
* `README.md`: add `three.xr.js` script include
* `README.md`: remove `../../../vendor/` path, to make the 3 includes consistent and more general
* `xr/basic/index.html`: move the script tag onto its own line
