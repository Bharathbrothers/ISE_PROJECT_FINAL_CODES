For the moment, we continue to accept numeric JSON IDs in signalling messages; later, once client code is updated, we'll break backwards compatibility. This change does make the user IDs returned in signalling responses into strings, which could break client code, but ours is resilient to that (and since IDs are opaque and only good for comparing equality probably other code is also resilient to that.)",mqp,428637,2018-04-10T02:11:30Z,COLLABORATOR,True,84,43,5,Janus plugin to act as a kind of SFU for game networking data.,Rust,11c92f24e328780127477b31c1a3030a5992bb72,"Store, accept string room and user IDs"
