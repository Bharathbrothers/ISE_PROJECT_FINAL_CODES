This swaps the data fork and the resource fork of a given file.
It can be useful to populate the resource fork with data now that
Linux support is not available anymore."

- respects the OPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS to force the openssl libraries to
  be linked statically (and only those).
- provides variables for the individual libraries.

The latter means dmg/CMakeLists.txt doesn't actually need to search for
libcrypto on its own, but can just use whatever FindOpenSSL found, which
respects OPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS.

Unfortunately, statically linking libcrypto requires linking against
libdl, so we also link CMAKE_DL_LIBS when OPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS is set.",glandium,1038527,2017-12-28T11:16:20Z,NONE,True,1,7,1,Portable libraries and utilities that manipulate HFS+ volumes and Apple's DMG images.
