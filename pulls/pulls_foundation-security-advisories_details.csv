As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

100,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/foundation-security-advisories/pulls/4,4,Please merge my cleanup commits (rebased version of closed pull request #3),"#### Obvious bugs
1. I ran the advisory pool through my XML parser,  and it choked on a number of **obvious HTML bugs**. There is one commit to address all of these.
2. My link parser then stumbled across a sizable number of **malformed Bugzilla URLs**. This pull request addresses these, too. Some are particularly regular, having certain bug IDs prefixed with **&amp;#10;**, suggesting they were created by a **broken extraction or conversion script** incorrectly handling line breaks inside of URLs.
3. Lastly I found a line-broken _title_ in the header of one advisory which later turned out to be the result of a **duplication of the title**, likely due to a copy&paste issue.
#### Headers

I touched two **advisory headers** to make them **consistent** with the rest:
1. One lonely advisory was using the **fix_released** field back in 2006 which is essentially **redundant** to the **announced** field. (Please note that this commit mistakenly refers to the _fixed_in_ header field instead.)
2. There was a single occurrence of the **affects** header field in 2006, which was probably just a misnomer of the **vulnerable** field that was used throughout 2005.
