The test seems to always fail when waiting for the ""entering"" class to appear on an element. The test was waiting for this class to appear and then disappear. I am guessing that perhaps the class is appearing and disappearing so quickly that sometimes the wait doesn't catch the appearance. I have changed the logic not to look for the appearance of the ""entering"" class, but rather to wait for the panel to be visible and also for the entering class to be gone. This seems to work in my test runs, so I suggest we see if it solves the intermittent failure.

109,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/input-tests/pulls/102,102,Migrate to WebDriver API,"This is the migration to the WebDriver API, however there are also a few minor fixes and improvements that were in the way of a migration. Please comment if you have any questions and I will do my best to clarify. It would be very valuable to get a lot of people to look at these changes both from a perspective of reviewing them, but also as assistance with the migration of other projects.

**Note:** Please do not merge this until it's been approved. There will need to be changes to the Jenkins jobs and quite possibly to the Selenium nodes (we have relatively few WebDriver nodes, especially on the platforms that may be needed).
### Known issues
- The datepicker tests will only pass if Firefox has focus.
- Getting the message count from filters requires hovering over the filter items. As this is not supported on all platforms I have instead used JavaScript to get the text (this is how Selenium RC does it). I have added a TODO to fix this in the future. If we decide not to run on Mac then we may be able to change this sooner.
- I'm using the Select support class, which will be available in Selenium 2.12.0 and up.
### Summary of typical changes
- Locators changed to tuples, with the strategy and locator included.
- Selenium API changed to WebDriver.
- Removal of waiting for pages to load and elements to be visible (now relying on implicit waits).
- Explicit waits added where necessary.
- Repeating region objects no longer need a count and singular property. All objects are returned, count is obtained using `len`, and individual items accessed using indices.
### Other changes:
- Removed some unused page region classes (it wasn't possible to test them under a new API if they're not used).
- Renamed methods/classes where I felt it better suited to new API or just to clean up.
- Made minor fixes where possible as a necessity for testing the migration. As a result there will be some extra XPasses, which we should look into.

- The datepicker tests will only pass if Firefox has focus.
- Getting the message count from filters requires hovering over the filter items. As this is not supported on all platforms I have instead used JavaScript to get the text (this is how Selenium RC does it). I have added a TODO to fix this in the future. If we decide not to run on Mac then we may be able to change this sooner.
- I'm using the Select support class, which will be available in Selenium 2.12.0 and up.
### Summary of typical changes
- Locators changed to tuples, with the strategy and locator included.
- Selenium API changed to WebDriver.
- Removal of waiting for pages to load and elements to be visible (now relying on implicit waits).
- Explicit waits added where necessary.
- Repeating region objects no longer need a count and singular property. All objects are returned, count is obtained using `len`, and individual items accessed using indices.
### Other changes:
- Removed some unused page region classes (it wasn't possible to test them under a new API if they're not used).
- Renamed methods/classes where I felt it better suited to new API or just to clean up.
- Made minor fixes where possible as a necessity for testing the migration. As a result there will be some extra XPasses, which we should look into.

Basically, a few things have been split out into _region.py files where they are used from multiple pages but don't belong in a 'base' page. Also, the base page has been slimmed down because previously it contained a lot of feedback page specific methods and properties.

I removed hard-coded values too, and made all files PEP8 valid.

I also reworked the test_similar_messages test, to use page region objects.

There's more refactoring we could do, for example:
- Make the licenses consistent (I have seen two variations, which also exist in the templates project)
- Make naming of page object variables consistent (we use name_pg_obj, name_page_obj, name_pg, etc)
- Methods could return page objects when an action causes a new page (would save all the page objects  needing to be instantiated)
- Use string formats instead of concatenation
- Move page objects and page region objects into subdirs
- I'm sure there's more?
