22,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/affiliates/pulls/227,227,Bug 983717: Fraud detection,"Adds very basic fraud detection for link clicks (and the other, unused metrics too).

There's two levels:
- Suspicious user agents, like wget or curl. The list of suspicious user agents is small, but then again circumventing this is super-easy so maybe it doesn't matter. We've seen users using these tools without special user agents so we might as well do it.
- IP address rate-limiting. Essentially, if a single IP sends too many link clicks to a specific link in a single day, all but one of their clicks gets removed. We also check larger IP groups for larger amounts of clicks: For ipv4, we check the C block, and for ipv6, we check the /48 prefix.

If fraudulent clicks are detected, they are removed and we log the removal, along with the reason for removal. There's an admin action for reversing these removals if the admins decide a removal was wrong.

There's no documentation of the feature yet because I want to get this in and see what kind've fraud it detects on production before we finish it up for admin use.

In the old site, when users clicked on a link in a banner, they would make a request that incremented a counter in the Affiliates database, and be sent a 302 redirect to their final destination.

In this new system, we instead have users hit an intermediate page that has Google Analytics on it, and we synchronously log their pageview with Google Analytics before redirecting them on their way (a future PR will include a <meta> redirect for users without JavaScript enabled). Then, the site uses the [Google Analytics Core Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/coreDevguide) to retrieve the click data from Google Analytics for the previous day.

The upside is that Google Analytics provides many more options for viewing and filtering click data. Future PRs will have us either embedding or generating links to Google Analytics views for click data, instead of having to come up with graphing and stats views ourselves. 

If you want to test this on a local instance, you'll have to create a Google Analytics profile for testing. The `GA_ACCOUNT_CODE` is the tracking ID Google Analytics gives you ([docs](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032385?hl=en)).

The `GA_PROFILE_ID` setting value is the profile ID, [which is a little annoying to retrieve](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/analytics/dRuAr1K4waI). You'll also need to create a service account. Service accounts are tied to a [Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project) app. You create an app with the dev console, then create a service account and download the p12 key for the account. `GA_API_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` is the email address for the service account, while `GA_API_KEYFILE` is the path to the keyfile you download. [There's some slightly helpful docs for creating a service account and getting the credentials you need for them.](https://developers.google.com/drive/web/service-accounts#use_service_accounts_as_application-owned_accounts).

You will also need to grant read access to the service account for your test GA profile ([docs](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495?hl=en)). Use the email from the `GA_API_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` setting for specifying the service account as a user. Then, once the service account is created, has read permissions, and you've set the app up to authenticate as the service account, you should be good to go! You'll then be able to create a banner, and if you click on it, see the data show up in your test GA profile (the real-time dashboard is super-useful for testing), and then be able to pull the data from the API using the management command (which, by default, pulls the data from the previous day UTC; I should probably add the date as an argument to the command).

The general idea is that the ""Link"" model will represent all generated banners, and will have little to no knowledge of the banner it came from. This lets us avoid the problem of maintaining a link to the banner that generated the link when we have multiple types of banners (text banners, image banners, banners with JS code). This should also let us avoid having to change banner URLs again if the set of available banners change, since links don't need that info.

In addition, django-mptt is used for categories as it's an easier interface and has some useful functions even though we're currently limiting it to two categories deep.

The migrations in 7cb92fb are custom and need to be closely reviewed. I've run them on the dataset from affiliates-dev and they seem to work fine (let me know if you want a copy of the data to test on for yourself). In particular they preserve the FKs from the old banners in order to support current Affiliate banner URLs when the URLs change.
