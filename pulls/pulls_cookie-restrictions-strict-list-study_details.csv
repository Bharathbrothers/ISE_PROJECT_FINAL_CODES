1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

9,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cookie-restrictions-strict-list-study/pulls/10,10,"Upgrade to new default-prefs multipreffer, recompute category pref at init as well as cleanup.","Based on everything I've learned about default prefs, etc in the last weeks, I refactored multipreffer to only support setting default-branch prefs. This simplifies testing as well as cleanup, and also is a much better way to do experiments (since it better represents ""real world""). The limitation is that consumers that try to access these pref values before multipreffer gets initialized can't be supported. I think this is reasonable.

I also refactored this add-on to use the new multipreffer, and to force browserglue to compute the category pref both at init and cleanup - again, this I think makes the category pref take on a ""real world"" representative value.

If we still want to set it to ""custom"" during the experiment, we can do that, no problem - but I think that if we do, it needs to be paired with an assertion `the new values we are testing are not going to be considered ""standard"" - they are indeed going to be considered ""custom""`.",nhnt11,485488,2019-03-25T00:53:17Z,MEMBER,True,45,113,4,"A study that blocks tracking cookies from the strict list and the basic list, in two separate cohorts.",JavaScript,62af58a8cce04d6d3c7bf7cfc2c2420a3e003358,"Upgrade to new default-prefs multipreffer, recompute category pref at init as well as cleanup"

- uninstall the addon
- the user is not reset to the ""standard"" category

This adds the ability to change a pref that has a non-default value set, and reset it to that value upon ending.

By requiring the user to be in ""standard"" on startup, we are essentially adding a requirement that they have TP also set to default in order to enroll, is there any problem with this? This pref is harmless and only changes the UI in about:preferences, however in the experiment branch, by changing the cookieBehavior pref it will automatically become ""custom"" in the interest of keeping both UI experiences as close as possible to the control branch, they should both change to ""custom"".

- uninstall the addon

This adds the ability to change a pref that has a non-default value set, and reset it to that value upon ending. 
This also adds the pref ""browser.contentblocking.category"", and requires it to be ""standard"" initially, ""custom"" get set throughout the test, then it will set back to ""standard"" when finished.
Another option could be to use the existing ""resetValues"" attribute, and check that the pref matches that on installing?
