0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/airmozilla/pulls/828,828,"bad login failure page, fixes #827","This solves the problem for Air Mozilla. I had a very convoluted, but valid, way of testing this. 
First I log in, then I go into a Django shell and decode the session data in the database, In it there's a `oidc_id_token_expiration` which is a timestamp. I changed that back to a low number, encode the session data and put it back into the database. That simulates that the user is still signed in but needs to refresh its ID token. But before letting the browser do that automatically, I type in `http://localhost:8000/oidc/callback/?error=anything` in the address bar and then every time I get the crazy redirect loop. But I actually had to intercept the successful callbacks too to simulate Auth0 being really unhappy. 

With this patch that problem went away and it was no longer possible to simulate the problem.

 Users don't care if it errored or not. It's still ""transcoding"" as far as they're concerned. The event is still in the state of processing. 

This is what it looks like if it's got a positive number of seconds left:

I tried to get fancy but it never really worked well. This is simple and a good start. It's much better than what we have already. 

The clever thing is that when the seconds slowly drop down more and more, when it hits 100% the status of the event updates (thanks to Vid.ly informing us with a webhook) and updates to the event trigger the websocket to refresh the page.

This is a pull request for the [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=870015) you suggested I look at previously such that if the event status for a live event changes to pending or from pending to archived it will reload the page. Thanks for the suggestion it certainly felt a little more challenging!

I look forward to hearing any feedback as I wasn't 100% sure on the best way to do this one - particularly with respect to how the javascript accesses the data it needs from the html page.

I would also like to add a test for the view but I have held off doing that for now as I am still figuring out how to do that.

thanks, Alex

563,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/airmozilla/pulls/340,340,fixes bug 1170727 - Removing Response class duplication in tests,"As Peter Bengtsson advised to do on [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1170727), I moved the Response class that was duplicated across multiple test classes into airmozilla.base.tests.testbase.

Response was implemented slightly differently in airmozilla/manage/tests/test_autocompleter vs the rest. The `json()` method returned `json.loads(self.content)` instead of simply `self.content` like the Response class in the other test classes did.

Therefore I subclassed Response from airmozilla.base.tests.testbase in test_autocompleter with the slightly different `json()` method and called it `JsonLoadingResponse` since it is loading the json instead of just returning the content of the response.

Please let me know if this is not the best way to do it or if there is any way it can be improved and I will happily revisit. Thank you

for starters I tried to change the open graph fields for home, my thought was that it should link to home and display airmozilla logo, however something here is not  right, the first bug it has is the link gives me an error saying - 'views' is undefined - so that means the way I have linked to home is wrong. I am also not sure if the rest are okay. So some feedback and guidance on this will be extremely helpful.

Also I am thinking of removing  the content from `<meta name=""keywords"" content=""{{ ','.join(tags) }}"">` 
and adding the content ""home"" instead because home doesn't really have tags to join I suspect. 

Thanks you.

That's why the reference still persists. To rectify that, before rendering the page just check whether  the result from trying to get 'get_all_pictures' is the same as the result from the 'get_all_pictures+event.id' case. If it is, wonderful else something happened (this could be that the picture was deleted or a new picture was added or both happened, one after the other. In this case always go to the db and reset the cache values).

The test is only for the case mentioned in the bug.
