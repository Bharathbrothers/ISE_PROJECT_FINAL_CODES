My logic for passing through the optional arguments to `zrangebyscore`, added this morning in #67, turned out to be the cause of a frustrating bug that was causing my tests to fail this afternoon. It's obvious in hindsight, but passing the same options to `zremrangebyscore` was a foolish idea.

However it's not simply enough to just stop passing `...options` to `zremrangebyscore`, because that would allow `zrangebyscore` to return a different result set with the `offset` and `count` optional params. Instead I've simplified the interface and just pass `WITHSCORES` explicitly if specified now, which is all that's needed for the verification reminders script to work.

We need to pop verification reminders atomically, which we can do with Redis `MULTI` and `EXEC`. This change just wraps those round `zrangebyscore` and `zremrangebyscore`, similar to what we did previously for the `update` command. It also removes `zremrangebyscore` from the interface because we have no need to call it and don't want non-atomic usage creeping in in the future.

We want to use [Redis sorted sets](https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro#redis-sorted-sets) to store verification reminders. This PR just exposes a bunch of their methods.

I think I'll probably only need `zadd`, `zrangebyscore` and `zremrangebyscore` to implement verification reminders, but I exposed a bunch of others too because it didn't require any additional code to do so and I might find uses for them when I actually do that work.

There have been some indentation changes where I expose the method names as a property, so you'll probably want to review this with [`?w=1`](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-shared/pull/65/files?w=1).

12,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fxa-shared/pulls/61,61,refactor(redis): extract the auth server's redis abstraction,"As a pre-requisite for feature-flagging, this PR pulls the Redis abstraction out of the auth server so we can use it in the content server too.

The abstraction originates from mozilla/fxa-auth-server#2235 and a fair amount of discussion took place in that PR so if you have any questions about why things are done in a certain way, it might be worth having a read of that first. In particular, the error semantics of the node Redis client are kind of flaky and what's here is our battle-hardened approach to working sanely under those conditions.

The implementation depends on bluebird promises, although I know some on the team think we should be moving away from bluebird rather than towards it. In my defence, bluebird's disposer pattern is really handy for robustly managing connections and I'm not enthusiastic about re-implementing it from scratch here. I'd probably get it wrong, plus it heaps further testing and maintenance burden on us.

Note that the tests will now fail for anyone who doesn't have Redis installed, because there are some integration tests that require a real instance to run against. That might seem slightly odd because our config for connecting to Redis doesn't live in this repo, it is of course server-specific. I could have left the integration tests in the server repos alongside the config, but that would incur a lengthy interval between bugs being introduced here and then picked up during integration.

We want to emit a `login - complete` Amplitude event immediately after `login - forgot_complete`, so that the login numbers after account reset look correct in Amplitude. The cleanest way to do that from an API perspective is by adding an extra property to the event mappings that are passed into this repo. Taking a cue from CSS, I'm calling that property `after`.

So, given the following diff in the auth server:

```diff
diff --git a/lib/metrics/amplitude.js b/lib/metrics/amplitude.js
index 6faff195..5105b503 100644
--- a/lib/metrics/amplitude.js

...the changes here would achieve the desired outcome of a `login - complete` event that happens 1 millisecond after the `login - forgot_complete` event. They are made in such a way as to hopefully be reusable if similar scenarios crop up in the future.

Note that CI is updated to test in node 10 instead of node 6 because I added our new best pal, object spread syntax.

33,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fxa-shared/pulls/37,37,feat(metrics): return an array instead of a single event for amplitude,"Breaking change. Blocks mozilla/fxa-activity-metrics#110.

We want to emit a `login - complete` Amplitude event immediately after `login - forgot_complete`, so that the login numbers after account reset look correct in Amplitude. The cleanest way to do that from an API perspective is by adding an extra property to the event mappings that are passed into this repo. Taking a cue from CSS, I'm calling that property `after`.

So, given the following diff in the auth server:

```diff
diff --git a/lib/metrics/amplitude.js b/lib/metrics/amplitude.js
index 6faff195..5105b503 100644
--- a/lib/metrics/amplitude.js
+++ b/lib/metrics/amplitude.js
@@ -66,7 +66,11 @@ const EVENTS = {
   },
   'account.reset': {
     group: GROUPS.login,
-    event: 'forgot_complete'
+    event: 'forgot_complete',
+    after: {
+      group: GROUPS.login,
+      event: 'complete'
+    }
   },
   'account.signed': {
     group: GROUPS.activity,
```

...the changes here would achieve the desired outcome of a `login - complete` event that happens 1 millisecond after the `login - forgot_complete` event. They are made in such a way as to hopefully be reusable if similar scenarios crop up in the future.

Note that CI is updated to test in node 10 instead of node 6 because I added our new best pal, object spread syntax.

The test of `supportedLanguages.indexOf` was mistakenly checking against `0` instead of `-1`. This meant that the first item in our list of supported languages, arabic, was never being matched and other, unsupported ones were being matched.

Furthermore, the `accept-languages` package assumes it is initialised with an array of languages that are sorted in order of precedence. This meant our `defaultLanguage` option was effectively being ignored because it was not at the start of the list.

This change fixes both issues and tweaks the tests so that they will fail if either one regresses in the future.
