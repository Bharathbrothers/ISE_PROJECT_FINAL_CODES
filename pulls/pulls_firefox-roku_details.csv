0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/firefox-roku/pulls/1,1,video player updated to check for .ts extension for mpeg4 ts playback,"The Roku supports mpeg4 ts (transport stream).  The update checks the url for a file extension and if present will set the streamformat to ts, else sets it to mp4.  Should consider allowing the socket client to pass the streamformat, but for compatibility sake of existing apps, this will work.  Tested as working on a Roku 2 XS. Source video url that was tested had been transcoded on the fly to mpeg4 ts playing back correctly on the device.
