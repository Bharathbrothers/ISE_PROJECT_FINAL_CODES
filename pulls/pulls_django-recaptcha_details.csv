0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/django-recaptcha/pulls/3,3,added support of programmatic configuration,"Hello, I've added a possibility to configure ReCaptcha programmatically.

In my case I store settings in the database, so needed an option to bypass settings.py, but parameters from settings.py will still work.

r = ReCaptchaField() #uses settings.py
r = ReCaptchaField(private_key = '...', public_key = '...', use_ssl  = True) #use run time config

Would you merge it?

Also - the django-recaptcha module on the pypi.python.org is outdated - is there a way to refresh it?

If not - I am publishing django-recaptcha2 soon, because I really need this module installable via easy_install from the index.

Thank you.
