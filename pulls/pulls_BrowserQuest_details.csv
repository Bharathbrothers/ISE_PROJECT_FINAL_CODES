Just run the [node-arduino-socket](https://github.com/semu/node-arduino-socket) for piping the joystick's commands through a web socket to BrowserQuest…
1. Merge
2. Prepare your Arduino with a [SparkFun Joystick Shield Kit](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9760)
3. Upload [CallbackExample.pde](https://github.com/sudar/JoystickShield/blob/master/examples/CallbackExample/CallbackExample.pde) by Sudar Muthu
4. Get [node-arduino-socket](https://github.com/semu/node-arduino-socket) for Arduino-to-WebSocket communication and check [http://localhost:8099](http://localhost:8099) for connection
5. Start your BrowserQuest server on port 8000
6. Copy `client` and `shared` from merged BrowserQuest to [node-arduino-socket's](https://github.com/semu/node-arduino-socket) `public/browserquest`
7. Open [http://localhost:8099/browserquest/client](http://localhost:8099/browserquest/client) and enjoy BrowserQuest with a gamepad!
