- Adds functions to JS (`gettext`, and `ngettext`) and Nunjucks templates (`_` and `_plural`) to call into the localization system.
- Adds stubs for those functions until real localization is ready.
- Changes the Nunjucks rendering strategy to use an environment. This way globals can be added to the rendering context (such as `_` and `_plural`).
- Building an extraction task for use with Grunt that is compatible with the way Kitsune wants template files.
- Add gettext calls to all strings that should be localized in JS and Nunjucks files.
- Some clean up.

Things this does not do:
- Provide a solution for localizing all the strings current in plain html files. I suggest the parts of these files that contain localizable strings be converted into Nunjucks templates.
- Pull the localized strings back from Kitsune.
- Actually localize anything (only stubbed versions of `gettext` and friends are available). This will depend a lot on how we pull these strings back from Kitsune.
