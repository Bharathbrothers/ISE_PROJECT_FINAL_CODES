0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fxoss/pulls/221,221,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #220


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

The existing Agreement model has been renamed to SignedAgreement, and instead of storing a string for the version the user signed, it stores a ForeignKey to the agreement they signed. Existing agreements will have a null value, which we can manually set to the first agreement once the change is pushed and the first agreement is added.

The page for signing the agreement has been converted to a normal Django view as well, so we don't have to rely on the download agreement page being in the content tree anymore.

In order to update/change the agreement, admins will create a new agreement object, assign it a version string, and update the `DOWNLOAD_AGREEMENT_VERSION` setting to match the string of the new version. 

I realize now I still need to update the documentation for changing the agreement, but for now a review on the code that's there would be useful.

245,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fxoss/pulls/47,47,[46] Adjust Custom Fields,"Fixes #46 

Due to the way Mezzanine incorporates custom fields via the settings file, the migration for this PR requires special attention:

To run the migrations, in `project.settings.base.EXTRA_MODEL_FIELDS`, you'll need to temporarily include the removed fields:

```
    (
        ""mezzanine.pages.models.Page.closing"",
        ""TextField"",  # 'django.db.models.' is implied if path is omitted.
        (""Closing Paragraph"",),
        {""default"": '', ""blank"": True},
    ),
     (
        ""mezzanine.pages.models.Page.subtitle"",
        ""CharField"",  # 'django.db.models.' is implied if path is omitted.
        (""Subtitle"",),
        {""max_length"": 128, ""default"": '', ""blank"": True},
    )
```

Then execute:

`python manage.py migrate sandstone`

Once that is complete, remove the temp fields from `project.settings.base.EXTRA_MODEL_FIELDS`.

We likely should collapse the migrations at some point after these are run for fxoss, as the migration instructions for a new site or not straightforward either.

This is the simplest thing that could possibly work for translating the CMS content. There are still some kinks to work out here but I wanted to get some review started before I got too far out. This adds translation support for the `Page`, `RichTextPage`, `Link`, `Field` and `Form` models built into Mezzanine. Right now it is setup for two languages: English and French. Tested it out locally and it works to show either the English or French version of the page based on the `Accept-Language` header via the `LocaleMiddleware`.

But here are the problems. django-modeltranslation stores the translations in the same table as the model itself. This is very fast but it means that new fields need to be added to the Mezzanine tables. There is a management command `sync_translation_fields` to add them but it's not the easiest workflow. In particular it means adding a new language adds a new column per column to be translated. In the case of the form `Field` model that means 5 more columns per language.

This becomes more of a problem for the Admin forms. Right now it shows all of the languages together in the form. That there is a `title_en` and `title_fr` field one on top of the other. Additional languages make this form even longer. The current `Field` inline barely fits with just two language and adding a third will make this form unusable. The Admin has a built-in language switcher so it might be possible to only show the fields for the selected language. While this would make the form easier to use in some ways it would make it harder to know which languages haven't been completed. It would also make it hard to compare the text in the two languages. It just depends on what the content authors/translators need or want to input this content.

This is the simplest thing that could possibly work for translating the CMS content. There are still some kinks to work out here but I wanted to get some review started before I got too far out. This adds translation support for the `Page`, `RichTextPage`, `Link`, `Field` and `Form` models built into Mezzanine. Right now it is setup for two languages: English and French. Tested it out locally and it works to show either the English or French version of the page based on the `Accept-Language` header via the `LocaleMiddleware`.

But here are the problems. django-modeltranslation stores the translations in the same table as the model itself. This is very fast but it means that new fields need to be added to the Mezzanine tables. There is a management command `sync_translation_fields` to add them but it's not the easiest workflow. In particular it means adding a new language adds a new column per column to be translated. In the case of the form `Field` model that means 5 more columns per language.

This becomes more of a problem for the Admin forms. Right now it shows all of the languages together in the form. That there is a `title_en` and `title_fr` field one on top of the other. Additional languages make this form even longer. The current `Field` inline barely fits with just two language and adding a third will make this form unusable. The Admin has a built-in language switcher so it might be possible to only show the fields for the selected language. While this would make the form easier to use in some ways it would make it harder to know which languages haven't been completed. It would also make it hard to compare the text in the two languages. It just depends on what the content authors/translators need or want to input this content.
