So far, the modified code can download and unzip JSDCov zipped artifacts. Also, walk through extracted JSON artifacts works too. At the moment, I still can't quite understand some of the objects, like artifact_etl, key, stream, etc. 

Here're some specific questions I have:
1. Both `generate` and `process_source_file` functions seems to assume the given obj is a url-based stream. I'm not exactly sure how to use a File object to replace that.
2. In line 82, can I use the same key for all the json files? (Before, it creates a key per JSON artifact, since every artifact has unique url)
3. In line 70, we use a tmp directory given by TempDirectory(). This doesn't work locally (on Mac) for me, so whenever I'm testing, I need to manually assign a tmpdir.
