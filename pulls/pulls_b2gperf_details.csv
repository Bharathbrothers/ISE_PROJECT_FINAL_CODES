I figured out that insane hack. It's because of this: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=858288. The sandbox that execute_*script runs in has to reset if we switch frames, but there's one case (switch_to_frame()) where we don't do that, and that triggers a bug where we reuse the sandbox of a different frame instead of the one we're currently in. I fixed this by removing the new_sandbox=False part on line 274. It doesn't do anything useful here anyway, other than triggering that bug.
