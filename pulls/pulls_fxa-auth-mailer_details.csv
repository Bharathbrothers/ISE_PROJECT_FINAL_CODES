This is broadly the same as the previous PR. The main difference is that I didn't realise the auth server invokes the mailer in-process before, so some redundant server nonsense has been removed. For the same reason, the interface for the package needed changing to return the `sms` module. I opted to return an object `{ email, sms }` but am open to other suggestions if anyone finds that offensive.

With the elimination of my imaginary server boundary, it made sense to pull the config and phone number validation up to the auth server level so those are both removed. And with the config gone, the `send-sms` script has moved over there too.

All that means the code here should be a bit simpler than it was. I think it's ready for review now but note that **we don't want to merge this until the auth server changes are also ready to be merged**. The aforementioned interface change requires equivalent changes in the auth server. 

You can see those auth server changes in the [phil/issue-1628 branch](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/compare/master...phil/issue-1628). I just need to sort out the correct sender id for USA/Canada and wire in the flow events before it, too, is ready to be reviewed.
