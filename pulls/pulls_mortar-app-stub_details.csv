Hopefully we can burninate the bug if you're OK with the changes, or at least we can start iterating (for example, replacing the 'fake' menu bar with x-menubar or the appropriate tag). I had a look at the Firefox OS style guide but I didn't copy the entire stylesheet in order to keep things simple and less overwhelming :-)

The first set of bullet points are two ways of getting the template. If you do one, you do not do the other.

The second set of bullet points are 2 steps to run the app. Do one then the other.

Folks unfamiliar with volo might think they have to run volo create after clone.

To clarify I just made the second set of bullets ordered.
