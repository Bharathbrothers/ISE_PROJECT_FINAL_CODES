0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools/pulls/513,513,bump the tc version number to 4.0.0 on tox,"Hi @armenzg , 

So after I set up my env by `python setup.py ` and `run tox`, I got this error https://pastebin.mozilla.org/9031957. It seems like the tox require treeherder-client 2.0.1 but the latest number is 4.0.0. I'm not sure if it's a bug, but after I change the version number to 4.0.0, everything works well.

Please close this pr if I misunderstand something.  Thank you.

@djmitche and I talked about how we'd like the arguments to the action task to look a bit today and settled on something along the lines of `mach taskgraph {{action}} {{action_args}}` which would end up being something like `mach taskgraph backfill --foo=bar`. This is a change to support that style. I'll have a PR for pulse_actions shortly after this is published.

As before, this argument can be omitted to default to production Treeherder.

Whilst treeherder-client 3.0.0 supports the old style arguments, they're deprecated.

In `TreeherderApi` I've stuck with the same argument name as used in `TreeherderClient` for greater consistency. In addition, calling `TreeherderApi(treeherder_server_url='foo')` feels a little redundant, since the class is only for Treeherder, so it's already clear about what `server_url` is referring.

The original test for buildbot_bridge did not completely mock everything
that it should. That caused the test to take over 10 seconds to run. In
order to speed this up I narrowed down the test to the creation of a
task and the appropriate setting of the metadata for it (original test
case).

We've also added a test module called helpers.py which allows tests to
easily activate adding debug messages. Doing this helps a lot when using
py.test with the -s flag (do not capture stdout). This helps when trying
to determine if functions are properly patched or not.

I've also renamed all tests making reference to a 'repo' repo name and
instead I'm using 'try' to make string matching easier.  I guess I could
have used 'mock-repo'."

First thanking you,mikeling,jmaher and all other guys who have encouraged me to contribute.
the change involves just adding try-catch blocks around the main() function in two files trigger.py and buildbot_to_taskcluster.py 

i am unable to test it on my system right now ,but mikeling has for buildbot_to_taskcluster.py .  I assume the same for trigger.py

feel free to test this on your system and merge it :)

We also add the ability to disable validation of buildernames and
revisions
since we can safely assume that Treeherder can only send valid revisions

We also add the ability to disable the progress bar when downloading

We can store a user's password in the keyring in an encrypted manner.
Unfortunately, we were not storing the password after prompting the
user.

We also fix in here a small regression where we started storing
the password with 'ldap' as the key instead of 'mozci'.

The error raised for corrupted files is different on Windows (it raises subprocess.CalledProcessError instead of IOError). Fixing this revealed another bug: the file was corrupted 100% of the time because it was opened in text mode when writing and reading, which converts \n bytes to \r\n on Windows.

The error message was so weird because there was another bug in the code: we were assuming that we would get a subprocess.CalledProcessError when gzip is not installed on the system but we actually get a OSError.

1 issue, 3 bugs. Windows is weird :)
