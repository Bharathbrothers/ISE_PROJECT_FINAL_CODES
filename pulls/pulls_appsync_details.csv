If Memcache is running the tests will use it and make sure it caches
Sauropod GETs on the meta document, and saves hits.

For the SQL backend, Memcache is mandatory for the tokens, if not

(We could do local verification right now by replacing vep.RemoteVerifier() with vep.LocalVerifier(), but that opens up the possibility of breakage when the identity team changes things in the spec)

Thoughts?
