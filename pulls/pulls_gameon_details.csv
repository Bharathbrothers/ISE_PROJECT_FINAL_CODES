The grand prize also includes the opportunity to have the winning game reviewed by Chillingo for possible publication on that site and by the Firefox Marketplace team who might feature it in the Firefox Marketplace. An internal review committee at each company will review the winning game and determine in the committee's sole discretion whether to publish or feature it. Winning the grand prize does not guarantee that the game will be published by Chillingo or featured in Firefox Marketplace. In order for the game to be eligible to be published by Chillingo the winning game must be a great title with consumer appeal and have the potential for commercial success. If Chillingo believes the winning title meets the criteria, Chillingo can decide whether or not to publish the game to HTML5 app stores and may also collaborate with the developer to port it to other platforms. The game must also be the sole creation of the developer, where Chillingo owns and the developer must be able to grant an exclusive license to Chillingo. Chillingo will require developers to sign a publishing agreement before it publishes the game. Chillingo reserves the right to determine whether or not to publish the one winning title from the Mozilla Game On competition. In order for the winning game to be in the Firefox Marketplace the game must meet the following criteria https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Marketplace_review_criteria and must comply with the Firefox Marketplace rules and policies which can be found at: https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/docs/policies/agreement and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Marketplace_review_criteria.

```

So, it looks like links with a `youtu.be` domain (which are currently the default when clicking ""share"" for youtube videos) are rejected, and it looks like URL with the words `youtube` or `vimeo` _anywhere_ in them are linkified (not embedded)--this isn't horrible, but seems a bit unexpected and I suspect the preferred behavior would be to fall-back to the thumbnail URL instead of showing the hyperlink.

One way to resolve this is to use [urlparse.parse()](http://docs.python.org/2/library/urlparse.html#urlparse.urlparse) to excise the domain and then compare it against a whitelist, rather than looking for the whitelisted words anywhere in the URL. This personally makes my internal ""spider-sense"" go off way less when thinking about potential security vulnerabilities, and also results in more predictable behavior... but it's just a suggestion.

So, it looks like links with a `youtu.be` domain (which are currently the default when clicking ""share"" for youtube videos) are rejected, and it looks like URL with the words `youtube` or `vimeo` _anywhere_ in them are linkified (not embedded)--this isn't horrible, but seems a bit unexpected and I suspect the preferred behavior would be to fall-back to the thumbnail URL instead of showing the hyperlink.

One way to resolve this is to use [urlparse.parse()](http://docs.python.org/2/library/urlparse.html#urlparse.urlparse) to excise the domain and then compare it against a whitelist, rather than looking for the whitelisted words anywhere in the URL. This personally makes my internal ""spider-sense"" go off way less when thinking about potential security vulnerabilities, and also results in more predictable behavior... but it's just a suggestion.
