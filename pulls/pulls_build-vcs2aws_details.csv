0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/build-vcs2aws/pulls/26,26,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #25


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

    files/user_keys -> files/host_user_keys

Created a new playbook, `update_secrets.yml` which includes
`tasks/install_keys.yml` so it can be run separately.

Added git.mozilla.org to the new file files/vcs_sync_known_hosts, which
is what started this reorg. :)
