It was built in-house by members of the production team several years ago. It's heavily broken on versions of Node 4.0 and above. This dependency doesn't reside on the Mozilla organization, so we have to drop it entirely.

This dependency causes the command ```npm install``` to fail when using Node 4.0 and above due to its dependence on ```dtrace-provider@0.2.8``` which severely breaks on newer versions of Node. The Travis CI build never failed because the node_modules directory was cached, so even after the upgrade to Node 4.0 this issue was never identified as a result of pre-built binaries being cached.

- click publish button
- sign in, fill in username, click ""create"" button.

**old code:** you should get an error about a missing username because the input#username element is searched for on the parent page, rather than the iframe the publish dialog is running in. (this is currently happening for goggles.mofostaging and goggles.webmaker bookmarklets)

**this patch:** things should work properly, with your username being accepted, and you getting logged in as said user.
