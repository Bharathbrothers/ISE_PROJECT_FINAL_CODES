This is just to stage what I have for front-end functional tests. Quite a number of test cases are missing and casperjs falls short when performing certain tests that involves more than just the browser (like drag-and-drop to upload image @yangshun).

Not sure how to test curation page and reviewer dashboard, which would require creating a fake account with reviewer rights.

Any comments or suggestions are welcomed.

- added styles for draggable
- made rows sortable, as well as created reorderGame function

Per discussions with @scottmeng, at the moment the request sends game slug and rank (see #169). The rank is zero-based, so if that needs to be changed let me know.  Also if we switched to a serialized JSON string, i will change this accordingly (shouldn't be difficult).

I am using [this library](https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable) for the drag and drop. Would you rather have the minimized css? I forgot to change it (used regular in case we needed to debug) but both are in the folder.

- Added buttons to view, edit, disable, and delete a game, using font-awesome icons and CSS tooltips to de-emphasize them somewhat
- Hooked up the delete / disable buttons to update the game's status accordingly
- Reworked style to match the mockups

This is what the page now looks like:

![](http://cl.ly/image/2N1q3j0d2Y3w/Image%202014-03-18%20at%205.26.44%20PM.png)

Other minor changes:
- Updated `dates.js` to append the ""ago"" suffix to relative dates, per the mockups
- Enhanced the `date` nunjucks filter in `helpers.js` to support short month names through the `med` option
- Added a `nocache` option to the `defer` nunjucks extension, which prevents use of the cache for that request (needed for the reviewer dashboard because the list of games under a given status can and will change, especially if the reviewer changes the status of a game themselves)
- Refactored the button colour styles in `buttons.styl` to use a mixin that reduces duplication, and added a `btn-disable` class for the disable button in the reviewer dashboard

@cvan Please let me know if changes to commonplace files are not kosher and I can figure out alternatives for some of the above changes.

There are still a couple of things left to be done that I figured could be done in a separate pull request:
- The view and edit buttons don't do anything yet
- The buttons displayed are the same regardless of the selected status (so the approve button is still shown in the list of approved games for example, which is definitely weird)

This pull request is somewhat dependent on #113 (since it refactors `review.styl` into a shared `dashboard.styl`), which will necessitate an ugly merge when it's done.

Fixes #121, #122, #123.

Other minor changes:
- Updated `dates.js` to append the ""ago"" suffix to relative dates, per the mockups
- Enhanced the `date` nunjucks filter in `helpers.js` to support short month names through the `med` option
- Added a `nocache` option to the `defer` nunjucks extension, which prevents use of the cache for that request (needed for the reviewer dashboard because the list of games under a given status can and will change, especially if the reviewer changes the status of a game themselves)
- Refactored the button colour styles in `buttons.styl` to use a mixin that reduces duplication, and added a `btn-disable` class for the disable button in the reviewer dashboard

@cvan Please let me know if changes to commonplace files are not kosher and I can figure out alternatives for some of the above changes.

There are still a couple of things left to be done that I figured could be done in a separate pull request:
- The view and edit buttons don't do anything yet
- The buttons displayed are the same regardless of the selected status (so the approve button is still shown in the list of approved games for example, which is definitely weird)

This pull request is somewhat dependent on #113 (since it refactors `review.styl` into a shared `dashboard.styl`), which will necessitate an ugly merge when it's done.

There are still a couple of things left to be done that I figured could be done in a separate pull request:
- The view and edit buttons don't do anything yet
- The buttons displayed are the same regardless of the selected status (so the approve button is still shown in the list of approved games for example, which is definitely weird)

This pull request is somewhat dependent on #113 (since it refactors `review.styl` into a shared `dashboard.styl`), which will necessitate an ugly merge when it's done.

Fixes #121, #122, #123.

213,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/galaxy/pulls/144,144,Enhancements to reviewer dashboard,"- Added a status dropdown menu to filter games by status, including logic to actually fetch the games matching the selected status
- Added buttons to view, edit, disable, and delete a game, using font-awesome icons and CSS tooltips to de-emphasize them somewhat
- Hooked up the delete / disable buttons to update the game's status accordingly
- Reworked style to match the mockups

Other minor changes:
- Updated `dates.js` to append the ""ago"" suffix to relative dates, per the mockups
- Enhanced the `date` nunjucks filter in `helpers.js` to support short month names through the `med` option
- Added a `nocache` option to the `defer` nunjucks extension, which prevents use of the cache for that request (needed for the reviewer dashboard because the list of games under a given status can and will change, especially if the reviewer changes the status of a game themselves)
- Refactored the button colour styles in `buttons.styl` to use a mixin that reduces duplication, and added a `btn-disable` class for the disable button in the reviewer dashboard

@cvan Please let me know if changes to commonplace files are not kosher and I can figure out alternatives for some of the above changes.

I've found that [Aviary](http://developers.aviary.com/docs/web/setup-guide) offers an HTML5 image resizing+cropping library that is perfect for our uses.

This pull request allows a developer to upload an icon from an external URL _or_ local file upload. Aviary does the image cropping, resizing, processing, and then it gives us back a URL of the image on Aviary's servers. We POST back that image URL when we POST the form to the API and the API should then do server-side processing to pipe the remote image to a local file (related to issue #76).

I haven't done this for the screenshots yet. I'll leave that up to y'all. But with Aviary we can easily constrain the aspect ratios and everything, so it's awesome.

This should be a good starting point for the media section. Let me know. Thanks, guys!
