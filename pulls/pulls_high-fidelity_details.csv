1,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/high-fidelity/pulls/93,93,Get Ember bugfix for major jQuery assertion error,"Newcomers doing `bower install` currently resolve to jQuery 1.12; in [emberjs/ember.js](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember.js/commit/a9ac424d86ebd472f48abd736cb20dccff991d7b) there is a silly jQuery detection assert error right in the framework loading sequence, resulting in a major fail as Ember cannot finish loading. 

Without the bugfix, [Ember apps with jQuery > 1.11 fail without even being able to load their app](ember-cli/ember-cli#5316). Indeed, I couldn't even run the tests on master. This results in a confusing error message, since 1.12 should be just fine (and of course it is):

`Uncaught Error: Assertion Failed: Ember Views require jQuery between 1.7 and 2.1`

This is fixed by updating to [emberjs/ember.js v1.13.13](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/a3e5bb96b9241c56e66cb6d749ecd644d7b113bf/CHANGELOG.md).

3,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/high-fidelity/pulls/91,91,Catalan translation,"I've made 2 contributtions:

1) added locale texts for catalan (ca)

2) added a new text label for the placeholder on the view podcast/new: podcast.URLplaceholder

Note: i've doubts about is it correct how i proceed with this second task. I means, i added the use of the new text label in the new.hsb, and also added its CORRECT translation on:

/app/locales/ca/translations.js
/app/locales/es/translations.js
/app/locales/en/translations.js

but also added the english translation to the other locales files... is this correct? Please, i would like an answer for do it well for future text labels in locales ;)

Indeed, i love this app. Could i work on make some minor improvements in CSS? i saw some minor issues.

Oh, and finally, i found 2 rare things:

A) when i execute the command ""ember build"" the /dist/manifest.webapp file generated has wrong the paths to index.html and to icons. It puts for example:

  ""launch_path"": ""/high-fidelity/index.html"",

instead of:

  ""launch_path"": ""/index.html"",

and then the desktop Firefox simulator (WebIDE) cannot run the app if you don't manually change that error :|

B) the second rare thing is that the great ""search icon"" on top toolbar in the app (once running in the FXOS simulator) point to the ""add new url podcast feed"" instead of to point to the ""search podcasts"". In this sense, the UI in this ""master"" branch is quite different from the version of the app that i've installed today from Marketplace... ¿?¿?¿? That mktp version has the menu at bottom (for example) and the GitHub version has it at top. Maybe i'm not understanding something?

I must put in clear that i'm a newbie in FXOS apps development, so please my apologies if i'm asking obvious things. Anyway, thanks in advance for your help.

on a device. *Phew!*"
