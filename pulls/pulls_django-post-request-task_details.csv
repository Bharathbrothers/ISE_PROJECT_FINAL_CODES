This adds things that @kumar303 requested in mozilla/olympia/pull/1495. While doing that I found a minor bug in the way arguments were passed, because of the weird signature [celery's `apply_async()`](http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/celery.app.task.html#celery.app.task.Task.apply_async) has. It didn't seem to have much consequences in our code, but tests revealed the issue so I changed it.
