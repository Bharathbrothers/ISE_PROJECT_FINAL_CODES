As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

When target SDK is 26+, adb cannot connect UNIX domain socket due to no permission by new security feature of Android O (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1462019).  Although Fennec still uses 23 for it, new GeckoView application such as VR Browser and etc will use 26+. 

Abstract socket address can still connect it even if Android O and Chrome uses it.  So we should support it on adbhelper.

If using abstract socket address, /proc/net/address shows ""@"" prefix like the following.
