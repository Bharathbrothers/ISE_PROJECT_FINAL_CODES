1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

`self.config.NotebookGist.oauth_client_id` is a lazy value, which can't be
serialized to JSON.  This crashes the writing of `notebook.json` by Jupyter,
and corrupts the `notebook.json` file.  This fix makes sure that value is a
string, otherwise it just sets it to `None`.  When `None`, the frontend will
helpfully warn (as it always has) that the user hasn't set up their oauth ids.

I've tested wiping my entire jupyter/ipython installation, then running the single command 'pip install .' and this grabs the dependencies as expected before installing our extension.

I have not yet tested installing via the remote repo, but I'll can test that once the pull request gets merged. I expected it to work the same as installing from a local directory.

I changed the readme to specify that (at least to the end user installing our extension), manually copying/symlinking gist.js is no longer necessary.

If you're testing out pip installs, to ""uninstall"" our extension after doing a pip install, wipe the following directories:

<PYTHON_INSTALL_DIRECTORY>/Lib/site-packages/jupyter-notebook-gist
<PYTHON_INSTALL_DIRECTORY>/Lib/site-packages/jupyter-notebook-gist-0.0.0-py3.5.egg-info
<JUPYTER_USER_DIRECTORY>/nbextensions/gist.js (for me, the full path to this was C:/Users/Lewis/AppData/Roaming/jupyter/nbextensions/gist.js)

There is a 'pip uninstall' command that exists, and we might want to add support for this in the future. Granted, it doesn't look like Jupyter Notebook uninstalls properly when I run this, so I don't know how much people actually expect that command to work. Implementing seems to be considered optional.

There does exists a way to do a pip install that creates symlinks for development use instead of actually copying files. This would let us run 'pip install -e .' once, then never again while we're developing, and the symlink makes sure we're always running the latest version. I haven't played around with this yet. The old method of manually copying gist.js and setting the config settings to point to the right directories should still work for now.

Having a few people test this on different OSs and different versions of python would be good. If you'd like to test, I'd recommend wiping anything in your .jupyter/.ipython config directories that you set up for this extension (other than the github client id/secret, as shown in the new readme). Also wipe the copy of gist.js you copied manually for development. After doing this, run the notebook to make sure the extension does not appear, then do the pip install and confirm that is does.
