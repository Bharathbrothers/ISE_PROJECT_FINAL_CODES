> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#5751](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5751): Fixed `TypeError` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
> 
> pytest 5.1.0 (2019-08-15)
> =========================
> 
> Removals
> --------
> 
> -   [\#5180](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5180): As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now removed:
> 
>     -   `Request.getfuncargvalue`: use `Request.getfixturevalue` instead.
>     -   `pytest.raises` and `pytest.warns` no longer support strings as the second argument.
>     -   `message` parameter of `pytest.raises`.
>     -   `pytest.raises`, `pytest.warns` and `ParameterSet.param` now use native keyword-only syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise `TypeError` on unknown keyword arguments as before.
>     -   `pytest.config` global variable.
>     -   `tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp` method.
>     -   `pytest_logwarning` hook.
>     -   `RemovedInPytest4Warning` warning type.
>     -   `request` is now a reserved name for fixtures.
> 
>     For more information consult [Deprecations and Removals](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html) in the docs.
> 
> -   [\#5565](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5565): Removed unused support code for [unittest2](https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/).
> 
>     The `unittest2` backport module is no longer necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn't seem to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.
> 
>     Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used at all (even if `unittest2` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to remove it in this release.
> 
>     If you experience a regression because of this, please [file an issue](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new).
> 
> -   [\#5615](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5615): `pytest.fail`, `pytest.xfail` and `pytest.skip` no longer support bytes for the message argument.
> 
>     This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use `""message""` instead of `u""message""`.
> 
>     Python 3 code is unlikely to pass `bytes` to these functions. If you do, please decode it to an `str` beforehand.
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   [\#5564](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5564): New `Config.invocation_args` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to `pytest.main()`.
> -   [\#5576](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5576): New [NUMBER](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.html#using-doctest-options) option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers. Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault's [numtest](https://github.com/boisgera/numtest) extension for doctest.

*Sourced from [pytest's changelog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst).*

> pytest 5.0.1 (2019-07-04)
> =========================
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#5479](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479): Improve quoting in `raises` match failure message.
> -   [\#5523](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523): Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example `-vs`) in Python 3.8+.
> -   [\#5547](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547): `--step-wise` now handles `xfail(strict=True)` markers properly.
> 
> Improved Documentation
> ----------------------
> 
> -   [\#5517](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517): Improve ""Declaring new hooks"" section in chapter ""Writing Plugins""
> 
> pytest 5.0.0 (2019-06-28)
> =========================
> 
> Important
> ---------
> 
> This release is a Python3.5+ only release.
> 
> For more details, see our [Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html).
> 
> Removals
> --------
> 
> -   [\#1149](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149): Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example typing `pytest --doctest-mod` inplace of `--doctest-modules`. This was previously allowed where the `ArgumentParser` thought it was unambiguous, but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins. See for example issues [\#1149](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149), [\#3413](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413), and [\#4009](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009).
> -   [\#5402](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402): **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**
> 
>     Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as possible, all warnings of type `PytestDeprecationWarning` now generate errors instead of warning messages.
> 
>     **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the [Deprecations and Removals](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html) section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.
> 
>     In the pytest `5.0.X` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop gap measure by adding this to your `pytest.ini` file:
> 
>     ``` {.sourceCode .ini}
>     [pytest]
>     filterwarnings =
>         ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning
>     ```
> 
>     But this will stop working when pytest `5.1` is released.
> 
>     **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a comment to [\#5402](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402).
> 
> -   [\#5412](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412): `ExceptionInfo` objects (returned by `pytest.raises`) now have the same `str` representation as `repr`, which avoids some confusion when users use `print(e)` to inspect the object.

> -   [\#1149](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149): Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example typing `pytest --doctest-mod` inplace of `--doctest-modules`. This was previously allowed where the `ArgumentParser` thought it was unambiguous, but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins. See for example issues [\#1149](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149), [\#3413](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413), and [\#4009](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009).
> -   [\#5402](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402): **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**
> 
>     Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as possible, all warnings of type `PytestDeprecationWarning` now generate errors instead of warning messages.
> 
>     **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the [Deprecations and Removals](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html) section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.
> 
>     In the pytest `5.0.X` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop gap measure by adding this to your `pytest.ini` file:
> 
>     ``` {.sourceCode .ini}
>     [pytest]
>     filterwarnings =
>         ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning
>     ```
> 
>     But this will stop working when pytest `5.1` is released.
> 
>     **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a comment to [\#5402](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402).
> 
> -   [\#5412](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412): `ExceptionInfo` objects (returned by `pytest.raises`) now have the same `str` representation as `repr`, which avoids some confusion when users use `print(e)` to inspect the object.
> 
> Deprecations
> ------------
> 
> -   [\#4488](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488): The removal of the `--result-log` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.
> -   [\#466](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466): The `funcargnames` attribute has been an alias for `fixturenames` since pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   [\#3457](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457): New [pytest\_assertion\_pass](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass) hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.
> 
>     This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.
> 
> -   [\#5440](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440): The [faulthandler](https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html) standard library module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.
> 
>     This functionality was provided by integrating the external [pytest-faulthandler](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler) plugin into the core, so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

> v3.11.0 (2019-05-15)
> ====================
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   `--showconfig` overhaul:
> 
>     -   now fully generated via the config parser, so anyone can load it by using the built-in python config parser
>     -   the `tox` section contains all configuration data from config
>     -   the `tox` section contains a `host_python` key detailing the path of the host python
>     -   the `tox:version` section contains the versions of all packages tox depends on with their version
>     -   passing `-l` now allows only listing default target envs
>     -   allows showing config for a given set of tox environments only via the `-e` cli flag or the `TOXENV` environment variable, in this case the `tox` and `tox:version` section is only shown if at least one verbosity flag is passed
> 
>     this should help inspecting the options. [\#1298](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1298)
> 
> v3.10.0 (2019-05-13)
> ====================
> 
> Bugfixes
> --------
> 
> -   fix for `tox -l` command: do not allow setting the `TOXENV` or the `-e` flag to override the listed default environment variables, they still show up under extra if non defined target - by gaborbernat [\#720](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/720)
> -   tox ignores unknown CLI arguments when provisioning is on and outside of the provisioned environment (allowing provisioning arguments to be forwarded freely) - by gaborbernat [\#1270](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1270)
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   Virtual environments created now no longer upgrade pip/wheel/setuptools to the latest version. Instead the start packages after virtualenv creation now is whatever virtualenv has bundled in. This allows faster virtualenv creation and builds that are easier to reproduce. [\#448](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/448)
> -   
> 
>     Improve python discovery and add architecture support:
> 
>     :   -   UNIX:
>             -   First, check if the tox host Python matches.
>             -   Second, check if the the canonical name (e.g. `python3.7`, `python3`) matches or the base python is an absolute path, use that.
>             -   Third, check if the the canonical name without version matches (e.g. `python`, `pypy`) matches.
>         -   Windows:
>             -   First, check if the tox host Python matches.
>             -   Second, use the `py.exe` to list registered interpreters and any of those match.
>             -   Third, check if the the canonical name (e.g. `python3.7`, `python3`) matches or the base python is an absolute path, use that.
>             -   Fourth, check if the the canonical name without version matches (e.g. `python`, `pypy`) matches.
>             -   Finally, check for known locations (`c:\python{major}{minor}\python.exe`).
> 
>     tox environment configuration generation is now done in parallel (to alleviate the slowdown due to extra checks). [\#1290](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1290)

> -   fix for `tox -l` command: do not allow setting the `TOXENV` or the `-e` flag to override the listed default environment variables, they still show up under extra if non defined target - by gaborbernat [\#720](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/720)
> -   tox ignores unknown CLI arguments when provisioning is on and outside of the provisioned environment (allowing provisioning arguments to be forwarded freely) - by gaborbernat [\#1270](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1270)
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   Virtual environments created now no longer upgrade pip/wheel/setuptools to the latest version. Instead the start packages after virtualenv creation now is whatever virtualenv has bundled in. This allows faster virtualenv creation and builds that are easier to reproduce. [\#448](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/448)

>     Improve python discovery and add architecture support:

>             -   First, check if the tox host Python matches.
>             -   Second, check if the the canonical name (e.g. `python3.7`, `python3`) matches or the base python is an absolute path, use that.
>             -   Third, check if the the canonical name without version matches (e.g. `python`, `pypy`) matches.
>         -   Windows:
>             -   First, check if the tox host Python matches.
>             -   Second, use the `py.exe` to list registered interpreters and any of those match.

>             -   Fourth, check if the the canonical name without version matches (e.g. `python`, `pypy`) matches.
>             -   Finally, check for known locations (`c:\python{major}{minor}\python.exe`).
> 
>     tox environment configuration generation is now done in parallel (to alleviate the slowdown due to extra checks). [\#1290](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1290)

> pytest 4.5.0 (2019-05-11)
> =========================
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   [\#4826](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4826): A warning is now emitted when unknown marks are used as a decorator. This is often due to a typo, which can lead to silently broken tests.
> -   [\#4907](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4907): Show XFail reason as part of JUnitXML message field.
> -   [\#5013](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5013): Messages from crash reports are displayed within test summaries now, truncated to the terminal width.
> -   [\#5023](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5023): New flag `--strict-markers` that triggers an error when unknown markers (e.g. those not registered using the [markers option]() in the configuration file) are used in the test suite.
> 
>     The existing `--strict` option has the same behavior currently, but can be augmented in the future for additional checks.
> 
> -   [\#5026](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5026): Assertion failure messages for sequences and dicts contain the number of different items now.
> -   [\#5034](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5034): Improve reporting with `--lf` and `--ff` (run-last-failure).
> -   [\#5035](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5035): The `--cache-show` option/action accepts an optional glob to show only matching cache entries.
> -   [\#5059](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5059): Standard input (stdin) can be given to pytester's `Testdir.run()` and `Testdir.popen()`.
> -   [\#5068](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5068): The `-r` option learnt about `A` to display all reports (including passed ones) in the short test summary.
> -   [\#5108](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5108): The short test summary is displayed after passes with output (`-rP`).
> -   [\#5172](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5172): The `--last-failed` (`--lf`) option got smarter and will now skip entire files if all tests of that test file have passed in previous runs, greatly speeding up collection.
> -   [\#5177](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5177): Introduce new specific warning `PytestWarning` subclasses to make it easier to filter warnings based on the class, rather than on the message. The new subclasses are:
>     -   `PytestAssertRewriteWarning`
>     -   `PytestCacheWarning`
>     -   `PytestCollectionWarning`
>     -   `PytestConfigWarning`
>     -   `PytestUnhandledCoroutineWarning`
>     -   `PytestUnknownMarkWarning`
> -   [\#5202](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5202): New `record_testsuite_property` session-scoped fixture allows users to log `<property>` tags at the `testsuite` level with the `junitxml` plugin.
> 
>     The generated XML is compatible with the latest xunit standard, contrary to the properties recorded by `record_property` and `record_xml_attribute`.
> 
> -   [\#5214](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5214): The default logging format has been changed to improve readability. Here is an example of a previous logging message:
> 
>         test_log_cli_enabled_disabled.py    3 CRITICAL critical message logged by test
> 
>     This has now become:
> 
>         CRITICAL root:test_log_cli_enabled_disabled.py:3 critical message logged by test
> 
>     The formatting can be changed through the [log\_format](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#confval-log_format) configuration option.
> 
> -   [\#5220](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5220): `--fixtures` now also shows fixture scope for scopes other than `""function""`.
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#5113](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5113): Deselected items from plugins using `pytest_collect_modifyitems` as a hookwrapper are correctly reported now.
> -   [\#5144](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5144): With usage errors `exitstatus` is set to `EXIT_USAGEERROR` in the `pytest_sessionfinish` hook now as expected.
> -   [\#5235](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5235): `outcome.exit` is not used with `EOF` in the pdb wrapper anymore, but only with `quit`.

> ---------
> 
> -   [\#5089](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5089): Fix crash caused by error in `__repr__` function with both `showlocals` and verbose output enabled.
> -   [\#5139](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5139): Eliminate core dependency on 'terminal' plugin.
> -   [\#5229](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5229): Require `pluggy>=0.11.0` which reverts a dependency to `importlib-metadata` added in `0.10.0`. The `importlib-metadata` package cannot be imported when installed as an egg and causes issues when relying on `setup.py` to install test dependencies.
> 
> Improved Documentation
> ----------------------
> 
> -   [\#5171](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5171): Doc: `pytest_ignore_collect`, `pytest_collect_directory`, `pytest_collect_file` and `pytest_pycollect_makemodule` hooks's 'path' parameter documented type is now `py.path.local`
> -   [\#5188](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5188): Improve help for `--runxfail` flag.

> pytest 4.4.0 (2019-03-29)
> =========================
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   [\#2224](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2224): `async` test functions are skipped and a warning is emitted when a suitable async plugin is not installed (such as `pytest-asyncio` or `pytest-trio`).
> 
>     Previously `async` functions would not execute at all but still be marked as ""passed"".
> 
> -   [\#2482](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2482): Include new `disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support` option to disable ascii-escaping in parametrized values. This may cause a series of problems and as the name makes clear, use at your own risk.
> -   [\#4718](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4718): The `-p` option can now be used to early-load plugins also by entry-point name, instead of just by module name.
> 
>     This makes it possible to early load external plugins like `pytest-cov` in the command-line:
> 
>         pytest -p pytest_cov
> 
> -   [\#4855](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4855): The `--pdbcls` option handles classes via module attributes now (e.g. `pdb:pdb.Pdb` with [pdb++]()), and its validation was improved.
> -   [\#4875](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4875): The [testpaths](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#confval-testpaths) configuration option is now displayed next to the `rootdir` and `inifile` lines in the pytest header if the option is in effect, i.e., directories or file names were not explicitly passed in the command line.
> 
>     Also, `inifile` is only displayed if there's a configuration file, instead of an empty `inifile:` string.
> 
> -   [\#4911](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4911): Doctests can be skipped now dynamically using `pytest.skip()`.
> -   [\#4920](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4920): Internal refactorings have been made in order to make the implementation of the [pytest-subtests](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-subtests) plugin possible, which adds unittest sub-test support and a new `subtests` fixture as discussed in [\#1367](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1367).
> 
>     For details on the internal refactorings, please see the details on the related PR.
> 
> -   [\#4931](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4931): pytester's `LineMatcher` asserts that the passed lines are a sequence.
> -   [\#4936](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4936): Handle `-p plug` after `-p no:plug`.
> 
>     This can be used to override a blocked plugin (e.g. in ""addopts"") from the command line etc.
> 
> -   [\#4951](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4951): Output capturing is handled correctly when only capturing via fixtures (capsys, capfs) with `pdb.set_trace()`.
> -   [\#4956](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4956): `pytester` sets `$HOME` and `$USERPROFILE` to the temporary directory during test runs.
> 
>     This ensures to not load configuration files from the real user's home directory.
> 
> -   [\#4980](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4980): Namespace packages are handled better with `monkeypatch.syspath_prepend` and `testdir.syspathinsert` (via `pkg_resources.fixup_namespace_packages`).
> -   [\#4993](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4993): The stepwise plugin reports status information now.
> -   [\#5008](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5008): If a `setup.cfg` file contains `[tool:pytest]` and also the no longer supported `[pytest]` section, pytest will use `[tool:pytest]` ignoring `[pytest]`. Previously it would unconditionally error out.
> 
>     This makes it simpler for plugins to support old pytest versions.
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#1895](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1895): Fix bug where fixtures requested dynamically via `request.getfixturevalue()` might be teardown before the requesting fixture.
> -   [\#4851](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4851): pytester unsets `PYTEST_ADDOPTS` now to not use outer options with `testdir.runpytest()`.
> -   [\#4903](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4903): Use the correct modified time for years after 2038 in rewritten `.pyc` files.
> -   [\#4928](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4928): Fix line offsets with `ScopeMismatch` errors.

> ===================
> 
> Bugfixes
> --------
> 
> -   The `-eALL` command line argument now expands the `envlist` key and includes all its environment. [\#1155](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1155)
> -   Isolated build environment dependency overrides were not taken in consideration (and such it inherited the deps from the testenv section) - by gaborbernat [\#1207](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1207)
> -   `--result-json` puts the command into setup section instead of test (pre and post commands are now also correctly put into the commands section) - by gaborbernat [\#1210](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1210)
> -   Set `setup.cfg` encoding to UTF-8 as it contains Unicode characters. [\#1212](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1212)
> -   Fix tox CI, better error reporting when locating via the py fails - by gaborbernat [\#1215](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1215)
> 
> v3.8.0 (2019-03-27)
> ===================
> 
> Bugfixes
> --------
> 
> -   In a posix shell, setting the PATH environment variable to an empty value is equivalent to not setting it at all; therefore we no longer if the user sets PYTHONPATH an empty string on python 3.4 or later - by gaborbernat. [\#1092](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1092)
> -   Fixed bug of children process calls logs clashing (log already exists) - by gaborbernat [\#1137](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1137)
> -   Interpreter discovery and virtualenv creation process calls that failed will now print out on the screen their output (via the logfile we automatically save) - by gaborbernat [\#1150](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1150)
> -   Using `py2` and `py3` with a specific `basepython` will no longer raise a warning unless the major version conflicts - by demosdemon. [\#1153](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1153)
> -   Fix missing error for `tox -e unknown` when tox.ini declares `envlist`. - by medmunds [\#1160](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1160)
> -   Resolve symlinks with `toxworkdir` - by blueyed. [\#1169](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1169)
> -   Interrupting a tox call (e.g. via CTRL+C) now will ensure that spawn child processes (test calls, interpreter discovery, parallel sub-instances, provisioned hosts) are correctly stopped before exiting (via the pattern of INTERRUPT - 300 ms, TERMINATE - 200 ms, KILL signals) - by gaborbernat [\#1172](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1172)
> -   Fix a `ResourceWarning: unclosed file` in `Action` - by BoboTiG. [\#1179](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1179)

> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   tox now auto-provisions itself if needed (see auto-provision). Plugins or minimum version of tox no longer need to be manually satisfied by the user, increasing their ease of use. - by gaborbernat [\#998](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/998)
> -   tox will inject the `TOX_PARALLEL_ENV` environment variable, set to the current running tox environment name, only when running in parallel mode. - by gaborbernat [\#1139](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1139)

> -   Display pattern and `sys.platform` with platform mismatch - by blueyed. [\#1176](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1176)

*Sourced from [pytest's changelog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst).*

> pytest 4.3.0 (2019-02-16)
> =========================
> 
> Deprecations
> ------------
> 
> -   [\#4724](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4724): `pytest.warns()` now emits a warning when it receives unknown keyword arguments.
> 
>     This will be changed into an error in the future.
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   [\#2753](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2753): Usage errors from argparse are mapped to pytest's `UsageError`.
> -   [\#3711](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3711): Add the `--ignore-glob` parameter to exclude test-modules with Unix shell-style wildcards. Add the `collect_ignore_glob` for `conftest.py` to exclude test-modules with Unix shell-style wildcards.
> -   [\#4698](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4698): The warning about Python 2.7 and 3.4 not being supported in pytest 5.0 has been removed.
> 
>     In the end it was considered to be more of a nuisance than actual utility and users of those Python versions shouldn't have problems as `pip` will not install pytest 5.0 on those interpreters.
> 
> -   [\#4707](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4707): With the help of new `set_log_path()` method there is a way to set `log_file` paths from hooks.
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#4651](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4651): `--help` and `--version` are handled with `UsageError`.
> -   [\#4782](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4782): Fix `AssertionError` with collection of broken symlinks with packages.

*Sourced from [pytest's changelog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst).*

> pytest 4.2.0 (2019-01-30)
> =========================
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> - `#3094 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3094>`_: `Class xunit-style <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/xunit_setup.html>`__ functions and methods
>   now obey the scope of *autouse* fixtures.
> 
>   This fixes a number of surprising issues like ``setup_method`` being called before session-scoped
>   autouse fixtures (see `#517 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/517>`__ for an example).
> 
> 
> - `#4627 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4627>`_: Display a message at the end of the test session when running under Python 2.7 and 3.4 that pytest 5.0 will no longer
>   support those Python versions.
> 
> 
> - `#4660 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4660>`_: The number of *selected* tests now are also displayed when the ``-k`` or ``-m`` flags are used.
> 
> 
> - `#4688 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4688>`_: ``pytest_report_teststatus`` hook now can also receive a ``config`` parameter.
> 
> 
> - `#4691 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4691>`_: ``pytest_terminal_summary`` hook now can also receive a ``config`` parameter.
> 
> 
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> - `#3547 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3547>`_: ``--junitxml`` can emit XML compatible with Jenkins xUnit.
>   ``junit_family`` INI option accepts ``legacy|xunit1``, which produces old style output, and ``xunit2`` that conforms more strictly to https://github.com/jenkinsci/xunit-plugin/blob/xunit-2.3.2/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/xunit/types/model/xsd/junit-10.xsd
> 
> 
> - `#4280 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4280>`_: Improve quitting from pdb, especially with ``--trace``.
> 
>   Using ``q[quit]`` after ``pdb.set_trace()`` will quit pytest also.
> 
> 
> - `#4402 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4402>`_: Warning summary now groups warnings by message instead of by test id.
> 
>   This makes the output more compact and better conveys the general idea of how much code is
>   actually generating warnings, instead of how many tests call that code.
> 
> 
> - `#4536 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4536>`_: ``monkeypatch.delattr`` handles class descriptors like ``staticmethod``/``classmethod``.
> 
> 
> - `#4649 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4649>`_: Restore marks being considered keywords for keyword expressions.

> pytest 4.1.1 (2019-01-12)
> =========================
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> - `#2256 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2256>`_: Show full repr with ``assert a==b`` and ``-vv``.
> 
> 
> - `#3456 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3456>`_: Extend Doctest-modules to ignore mock objects.
> 
> 
> - `#4617 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4617>`_: Fixed ``pytest.warns`` bug when context manager is reused (e.g. multiple parametrization).
> 
> 
> - `#4631 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4631>`_: Don't rewrite assertion when ``__getattr__`` is broken
> 
> 
> 
> Improved Documentation
> ----------------------
> 
> - `#3375 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3375>`_: Document that using ``setup.cfg`` may crash other tools or cause hard to track down problems because it uses a different parser than ``pytest.ini`` or ``tox.ini`` files.
> 
> 
> 
> Trivial/Internal Changes
> ------------------------
> 
> - `#4602 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4602>`_: Uninstall ``hypothesis`` in regen tox env.
> 
> 
> pytest 4.1.0 (2019-01-05)
> =========================
> 
> Removals
> --------
> 
> - `#2169 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2169>`_: ``pytest.mark.parametrize``: in previous versions, errors raised by id functions were suppressed and changed into warnings. Now the exceptions are propagated, along with a pytest message informing the node, parameter value and index where the exception occurred.
> 
> 
> - `#3078 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3078>`_: Remove legacy internal warnings system: ``config.warn``, ``Node.warn``. The ``pytest_logwarning`` now issues a warning when implemented.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#config-warn-and-node-warn>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3079 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3079>`_: Removed support for yield tests - they are fundamentally broken because they don't support fixtures properly since collection and test execution were separated.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#yield-tests>`__ on information on how to update your code.

> pytest 4.1.0 (2019-01-05)
> =========================
> 
> Removals
> --------
> 
> - `#2169 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2169>`_: ``pytest.mark.parametrize``: in previous versions, errors raised by id functions were suppressed and changed into warnings. Now the exceptions are propagated, along with a pytest message informing the node, parameter value and index where the exception occurred.
> 
> 
> - `#3078 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3078>`_: Remove legacy internal warnings system: ``config.warn``, ``Node.warn``. The ``pytest_logwarning`` now issues a warning when implemented.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#config-warn-and-node-warn>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3079 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3079>`_: Removed support for yield tests - they are fundamentally broken because they don't support fixtures properly since collection and test execution were separated.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#yield-tests>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3082 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3082>`_: Removed support for applying marks directly to values in ``[**pytest**](https://github.com/pytest).mark.parametrize``. Use ``pytest.param`` instead.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#marks-in-pytest-mark-parametrize>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3083 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3083>`_: Removed ``Metafunc.addcall``. This was the predecessor mechanism to ``[**pytest**](https://github.com/pytest).mark.parametrize``.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#metafunc-addcall>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3085 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3085>`_: Removed support for passing strings to ``pytest.main``. Now, always pass a list of strings instead.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#passing-command-line-string-to-pytest-main>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3086 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3086>`_: ``[pytest]`` section in **setup.cfg** files is not longer supported, use ``[tool:pytest]`` instead. ``setup.cfg`` files
>   are meant for use with ``distutils``, and a section named ``pytest`` has notoriously been a source of conflicts and bugs.
> 
>   Note that for **pytest.ini** and **tox.ini** files the section remains ``[pytest]``.
> 
> 
> - `#3616 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3616>`_: Removed the deprecated compat properties for ``node.Class/Function/Module`` - use ``pytest.Class/Function/Module`` now.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#internal-classes-accessed-through-node>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#4421 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4421>`_: Removed the implementation of the ``pytest_namespace`` hook.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#pytest-namespace>`__ on information on how to update your code.

>   ``--deselect`` (`#4127 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4127>`_).
> 
>   Test class instances are also not listed with ``--collect-only`` anymore.

> ==========================
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> - `#2619 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2619>`_: Resume capturing output after ``continue`` with ``__import__(""pdb"").set_trace()``.
> 
>   This also adds a new ``pytest_leave_pdb`` hook, and passes in ``pdb`` to the
>   existing ``pytest_enter_pdb`` hook.
> 
> 
> - `#4147 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4147>`_: Add ``-sw``, ``--stepwise`` as an alternative to ``--lf -x`` for stopping at the first failure, but starting the next test invocation from that test.  See `the documentation <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/cache.html#stepwise>`__ for more info.
> 
> 
> - `#4188 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4188>`_: Make ``--color`` emit colorful dots when not running in verbose mode. Earlier, it would only colorize the test-by-test output if ``--verbose`` was also passed.
> 
> 
> - `#4225 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4225>`_: Improve performance with collection reporting in non-quiet mode with terminals.
> 
>   The ""collecting …"" message is only printed/updated every 0.5s.
> 
> 
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> - `#2701 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2701>`_: Fix false ``RemovedInPytest4Warning: usage of Session... is deprecated, please use pytest`` warnings.
> 
> 
> - `#4046 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4046>`_: Fix problems with running tests in package ``__init__.py`` files.
> 
> 
> - `#4260 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4260>`_: Swallow warnings during anonymous compilation of source.
> 
> 
> - `#4262 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4262>`_: Fix access denied error when deleting stale directories created by ``tmpdir`` / ``tmp_path``.
> 
> 
> - `#611 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/611>`_: Naming a fixture ``request`` will now raise a warning: the ``request`` fixture is internal and
>   should not be overwritten as it will lead to internal errors.
> 
> - `#4266 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4266>`_: Handle (ignore) exceptions raised during collection, e.g. with Django's LazySettings proxy class.
> 
> 
> 
> Improved Documentation
> ----------------------
> 
> - `#4255 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4255>`_: Added missing documentation about the fact that module names passed to filter warnings are not regex-escaped.

> v3.5.3 (2018-10-28)
> -------------------
> 
> Bugfixes
> ^^^^^^^^
> 
> - Fix bug with incorrectly defactorized dependencies - by :user:`bartsanchez` (`#706 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/706>`_)
> - do the same transformation to ``egg_info`` folders that ``pkg_resources`` does;
>   this makes it possible for hyphenated names to use the ``develop-inst-noop`` optimization (cf. 910),
>   which previously only worked with non-hyphenated egg names - by
>   :user:`hashbrowncipher` (`#1051 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1051>`_)
> - previously, if a project's ``setup.py --name`` emitted extra information to
>   stderr, tox would capture it and consider it part of the project's name; now,
>   emissions to stderr are printed to the console - by :user:`hashbrowncipher` (`#1052 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1052>`_)
> - change the way we acquire interpreter information to make it compatible with ``jython`` interpreter, note to create jython envs one needs ``virtualenv > 16.0`` which will be released later :user:`gaborbernat` (`#1073 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1073>`_)

> v3.5.1 (2018-10-08)
> -------------------
> 
> Bugfixes
> ^^^^^^^^
> 
> - fix regression with ``3.5.0``: specifying ``--installpkg`` raises ``AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'basename'`` (`#1042 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1042>`_)
> 
> 
> v3.5.0 (2018-10-08)
> -------------------
> 
> Bugfixes
> ^^^^^^^^
> 
> - intermittent failures with ``--parallel--safe-build``, instead of mangling with the file paths now uses a lock to make the package build operation thread safe and is now on by default (``--parallel--safe-build`` is now deprecated) - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#1026 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1026>`_)
> 
> 
> Features
> ^^^^^^^^
> 
> - Added ``temp_dir`` folder configuration (defaults to ``{toxworkdir}/.tmp``) that contains tox
>   temporary files. Package builds now create a hard link (if possible, otherwise copy - notably in
>   case of Windows Python 2.7) to the built file, and feed that file downstream (e.g. for pip to
>   install it). The hard link is removed at the end of the run (what it points though is kept
>   inside ``distdir``). This ensures that a tox session operates on the same package it built, even
>   if a parallel tox run builds another version. Note ``distdir`` will contain only the last built
>   package in such cases. - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#1026 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1026>`_)
> 
> 
> Documentation
> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
> 
> - document tox environment recreate rules (:ref:`recreate`) - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#93 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/93>`_)
> - document inside the ``--help`` how to disable colorized output via the ``PY_COLORS`` operating system environment variable - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#163 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/163>`_)
> - document all global tox flags and a more concise format to express default and type - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#683 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/683>`_)
> - document command line interface under the config section `cli <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html?highlight=cli#cli>`_ - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#829 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/829>`_)

> pytest 3.8.2 (2018-10-02)
> =========================
> 
> Deprecations and Removals
> -------------------------
> 
> - `#4036 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4036>`_: The ``item`` parameter of ``pytest_warning_captured`` hook is now documented as deprecated. We realized only after
>   the ``3.8`` release that this parameter is incompatible with ``pytest-xdist``.
> 
>   Our policy is to not deprecate features during bugfix releases, but in this case we believe it makes sense as we are
>   only documenting it as deprecated, without issuing warnings which might potentially break test suites. This will get
>   the word out that hook implementers should not use this parameter at all.
> 
>   In a future release ``item`` will always be ``None`` and will emit a proper warning when a hook implementation
>   makes use of it.
> 
> 
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> - `#3539 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3539>`_: Fix reload on assertion rewritten modules.
> 
> 
> - `#4034 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4034>`_: The ``.user_properties`` attribute of ``TestReport`` objects is a list
>   of (name, value) tuples, but could sometimes be instantiated as a tuple
>   of tuples.  It is now always a list.

> 
> 
> - `#3941 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3941>`_: Fix bug where indirect parametrization would consider the scope of all fixtures used by the test function to determine the parametrization scope, and not only the scope of the fixtures being parametrized.

> pytest 3.8.0 (2018-09-05)
> =========================
> 
> Deprecations and Removals
> -------------------------
> 
> - `#2452 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2452>`_: ``Config.warn`` has been deprecated, it should be replaced by calls to the standard ``warnings.warn``.
> 
>   ``Node.warn`` now supports two signatures:
> 
>   * ``node.warn(PytestWarning(""some message""))``: is now the recommended way to call this function. The warning
>     instance must be a ``PytestWarning`` or subclass  instance.
> 
>   * ``node.warn(""CI"", ""some message"")``: this code/message form is now deprecated and should be converted to
>     the warning instance form above.
> 
>   ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` and ``PytestExperimentalApiWarning`` are now part of the public API and should be accessed
>   using ``pytest.RemovedInPytest4Warning`` and ``pytest.PytestExperimentalApiWarning``.
> 
> 
> - `#3936 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3936>`_: ``[**pytest**](https://github.com/pytest).mark.filterwarnings`` second parameter is no longer regex-escaped,
>   making it possible to actually use regular expressions to check the warning message.
> 
>   **Note**: regex-escaping the match string was an implementation oversight that might break test suites which depend
>   on the old behavior.
> 
> 
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> - `#2452 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2452>`_: Internal pytest warnings are now issued using the standard ``warnings`` module, making it possible to use
>   the standard warnings filters to manage those warnings. This introduces ``PytestWarning``,
>   ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` and ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning types as part of the public API.
> 
>   Consult `the documentation <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html#internal-pytest-warnings>`_ for more info.
> 
> 
> - `#2908 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2908>`_: ``DeprecationWarning`` and ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are now shown by default if no other warning filter is
>   configured. This makes pytest more compliant with
>   `PEP-0506 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0565/#recommended-filter-settings-for-test-runners>`_. See
>   `the docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html#deprecationwarning-and-pendingdeprecationwarning>`_ for
>   more info.
> 
> 
> - `#3251 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3251>`_: Warnings are now captured and displayed during test collection.
> 
> 
> - `#3784 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3784>`_: ``PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD`` environment variable disables plugin auto-loading when set.

<details>

   ### 2.1.0
   ```
   ==================

Bugfixes
--------

- Replace use of ``implprefix`` with ``HookimplMarker`` due to deprecation.

  Existing PyPOM plugins will need to be updated to import the `hookimpl` and use
  it to decorate hook implementations rather than rely on the prefix of the
  function names.

  Before::

    def pypom_after_wait_for_page_to_load(page):
        pass

  After::

    from pypom import hookimpl

    hookimpl

- `3774 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3774&gt;`_: Fix bug where decorated fixtures would lose functionality (for example ``mock.patch``).


- `3775 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3775&gt;`_: Fix bug where importing modules or other objects with prefix ``pytest_`` prefix would raise a ``PluginValidationError``.


- `3788 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3788&gt;`_: Fix ``AttributeError`` during teardown of ``TestCase`` subclasses which raise an exception during ``__init__``.


- `3804 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3804&gt;`_: Fix traceback reporting for exceptions with ``__cause__`` cycles.

   ### 2.1.0
   ```
   ==================

Bugfixes
--------

- Replace use of ``implprefix`` with ``HookimplMarker`` due to deprecation.

  Existing PyPOM plugins will need to be updated to import the `hookimpl` and use
  it to decorate hook implementations rather than rely on the prefix of the
  function names.

    def pypom_after_wait_for_page_to_load(page):
        pass

  After::

    from pypom import hookimpl

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **3.6.4** to **3.7.1**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.7.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `3473 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3473&gt;`_: Raise immediately if ``approx()`` is given an expected value of a type it doesn&#39;t understand (e.g. strings, nested dicts, etc.).


- `3712 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3712&gt;`_: Correctly represent the dimensions of an numpy array when calling ``repr()`` on ``approx()``.

- `3742 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3742&gt;`_: Fix incompatibility with third party plugins during collection, which produced the error ``object has no attribute &#39;_collectfile&#39;``.

- `3745 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3745&gt;`_: Display the absolute path if ``cache_dir`` is not relative to the ``rootdir`` instead of failing.


- `3747 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3747&gt;`_: Fix compatibility problem with plugins and the warning code issued by fixture functions when they are called directly.


- `3748 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3748&gt;`_: Fix infinite recursion in ``pytest.approx`` with arrays in ``numpy&lt;1.13``.


- `3757 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3757&gt;`_: Pin pathlib2 to ``&gt;=2.2.0`` as we require ``__fspath__`` support.


- `3763 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3763&gt;`_: Fix ``TypeError`` when the assertion message is ``bytes`` in python 3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.7.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- `2639 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2639&gt;`_: ``pytest_namespace`` has been deprecated.

  See the documentation for ``pytest_namespace`` hook for suggestions on how to deal
  with this in plugins which use this functionality.


- `3661 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3661&gt;`_: Calling a fixture function directly, as opposed to request them in a test function, now issues a ``RemovedInPytest4Warning``. It will be changed into an error in pytest ``4.0``.

  This is a great source of confusion to new users, which will often call the fixture functions and request them from test functions interchangeably, which breaks the fixture resolution model.



Features
--------

- `2283 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2283&gt;`_: New ``package`` fixture scope: fixtures are finalized when the last test of a *package* finishes. This feature is considered **experimental**, so use it sparingly.


- `3576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3576&gt;`_: ``Node.add_marker`` now supports an ``append=True/False`` parameter to determine whether the mark comes last (default) or first.


- `3579 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3579&gt;`_: Fixture ``caplog`` now has a ``messages`` property, providing convenient access to the format-interpolated log messages without the extra data provided by the formatter/handler.


- `3610 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3610&gt;`_: New ``--trace`` option to enter the debugger at the start of a test.


- `3623 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3623&gt;`_: Introduce ``pytester.copy_example`` as helper to do acceptance tests against examples from the project.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `2220 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2220&gt;`_: Fix a bug where fixtures overridden by direct parameters (for example parametrization) were being instantiated even if they were not being used by a test.


- `3695 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3695&gt;`_: Fix ``ApproxNumpy`` initialisation argument mixup, ``abs`` and ``rel`` tolerances were flipped causing strange comparsion results.
  Add tests to check ``abs`` and ``rel`` tolerances for ``np.array`` and test for expecting ``nan`` with ``np.array()``


- `980 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/980&gt;`_: Fix truncated locals output in verbose mode.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `3295 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3295&gt;`_: Correct the usage documentation of ``--last-failed-no-failures`` by adding the missing ``--last-failed`` argument in the presented examples, because they are misleading and lead to think that the missing argument is not needed.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `3519 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3519&gt;`_: Now a ``README.md`` file is created in ``.pytest_cache`` to make it clear why the directory exists.

   ### 3.7.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- `2639 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2639&gt;`_: ``pytest_namespace`` has been deprecated.

  See the documentation for ``pytest_namespace`` hook for suggestions on how to deal
  with this in plugins which use this functionality.


- `3661 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3661&gt;`_: Calling a fixture function directly, as opposed to request them in a test function, now issues a ``RemovedInPytest4Warning``. It will be changed into an error in pytest ``4.0``.

  This is a great source of confusion to new users, which will often call the fixture functions and request them from test functions interchangeably, which breaks the fixture resolution model.



Features
--------

- `2283 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2283&gt;`_: New ``package`` fixture scope: fixtures are finalized when the last test of a *package* finishes. This feature is considered **experimental**, so use it sparingly.


- `3576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3576&gt;`_: ``Node.add_marker`` now supports an ``append=True/False`` parameter to determine whether the mark comes last (default) or first.


- `3579 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3579&gt;`_: Fixture ``caplog`` now has a ``messages`` property, providing convenient access to the format-interpolated log messages without the extra data provided by the formatter/handler.


- `3610 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3610&gt;`_: New ``--trace`` option to enter the debugger at the start of a test.


- `3623 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3623&gt;`_: Introduce ``pytester.copy_example`` as helper to do acceptance tests against examples from the project.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `2220 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2220&gt;`_: Fix a bug where fixtures overridden by direct parameters (for example parametrization) were being instantiated even if they were not being used by a test.


- `3695 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3695&gt;`_: Fix ``ApproxNumpy`` initialisation argument mixup, ``abs`` and ``rel`` tolerances were flipped causing strange comparsion results.
  Add tests to check ``abs`` and ``rel`` tolerances for ``np.array`` and test for expecting ``nan`` with ``np.array()``


- `980 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/980&gt;`_: Fix truncated locals output in verbose mode.

----------------------

- `3295 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3295&gt;`_: Correct the usage documentation of ``--last-failed-no-failures`` by adding the missing ``--last-failed`` argument in the presented examples, because they are misleading and lead to think that the missing argument is not needed.

------------------------

### Update [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest) from **3.6.3** to **3.6.4**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.6.4
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Invoke pytest using ``-mpytest`` so ``sys.path`` does not get polluted by packages installed in ``site-packages``. (`742 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/742&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Use ``smtp_connection`` instead of ``smtp`` in fixtures documentation to avoid possible confusion. (`3592 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3592&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Remove obsolete ``__future__`` imports. (`2319 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2319&gt;`_)

- Add CITATION to provide information on how to formally cite pytest. (`3402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3402&gt;`_)

- Replace broken type annotations with type comments. (`3635 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3635&gt;`_)

- Pin ``pluggy`` to ``&lt;0.8``. (`3727 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3727&gt;`_)

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.22.5
   ```
   ================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `321 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/321&gt;`_: Revert change that dropped support for ``pytest&lt;3.4`` and require ``six``.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.22.4
   ```
   ================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `305 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/305&gt;`_: Remove last references to obsolete ``py.code``.

  Remove some unnecessary references to ``py.builtin``.

- `316 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/316&gt;`_: Workaround cpu detection on Travis CI.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 1.22.3
   ```
   ================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix issue of virtualized or containerized environments not reporting the number of CPUs correctly. (`9 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/9&gt;`_)


Trivial Changes
---------------

- Make all classes subclass from ``object`` and fix ``super()`` call in ``LoadFileScheduling``; (`297 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/297&gt;`_)

   ### 3.6.0
   ```
   =========================

Features
--------

- Revamp the internals of the ``pytest.mark`` implementation with correct per
  node handling which fixes a number of long standing bugs caused by the old
  design. This introduces new ``Node.iter_markers(name)`` and
  ``Node.get_closest_mark(name)`` APIs. Users are **strongly encouraged** to
  read the `reasons for the revamp in the docs
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.htmlmarker-revamp-and-iteration&gt;`_,
  or jump over to details about `updating existing code to use the new APIs
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.htmlupdating-code&gt;`_. (`3317
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3317&gt;`_)

- Now when ``pytest.fixture`` is applied more than once to the same function a
  ``ValueError`` is raised. This buggy behavior would cause surprising problems
  and if was working for a test suite it was mostly by accident. (`2334
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2334&gt;`_)

- Support for Python 3.7&#39;s builtin ``breakpoint()`` method, see `Using the
  builtin breakpoint function
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlbreakpoint-builtin&gt;`_ for
  details. (`3180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3180&gt;`_)

- ``monkeypatch`` now supports a ``context()`` function which acts as a context
  manager which undoes all patching done within the ``with`` block. (`3290
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3290&gt;`_)

- The ``--pdb`` option now causes KeyboardInterrupt to enter the debugger,
  instead of stopping the test session. On python 2.7, hitting CTRL+C again
  exits the debugger. On python 3.2 and higher, use CTRL+D. (`3299
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3299&gt;`_)

- pytest not longer changes the log level of the root logger when the
  ``log-level`` parameter has greater numeric value than that of the level of
  the root logger, which makes it play better with custom logging configuration
  in user code. (`3307 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3307&gt;`_)


Bug Fixes
---------

- A rare race-condition which might result in corrupted ``.pyc`` files on
  Windows has been hopefully solved. (`3008
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3008&gt;`_)

- Also use iter_marker for discovering the marks applying for marker
  expressions from the cli to avoid the bad data from the legacy mark storage.
  (`3441 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3441&gt;`_)

- When showing diffs of failed assertions where the contents contain only
  whitespace, escape them using ``repr()`` first to make it easy to spot the
  differences. (`3443 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3443&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Change documentation copyright year to a range which auto-updates itself each
  time it is published. (`3303
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3303&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- ``pytest`` now depends on the `python-atomicwrites
  &lt;https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites&gt;`_ library. (`3008
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3008&gt;`_)

- Update all pypi.python.org URLs to pypi.org. (`3431
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3431&gt;`_)

- Detect `pytest_` prefixed hooks using the internal plugin manager since
  ``pluggy`` is deprecating the ``implprefix`` argument to ``PluginManager``.
  (`3487 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3487&gt;`_)

- Import ``Mapping`` and ``Sequence`` from ``_pytest.compat`` instead of
  directly from ``collections`` in ``python_api.py::approx``. Add ``Mapping``
  to ``_pytest.compat``, import it from ``collections`` on python 2, but from
  ``collections.abc`` on Python 3 to avoid a ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python
  3.7 or newer. (`3497 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3497&gt;`_)

This officially ships tomorrow, but the build is already available via FTP.

This obviously won't fix the failures in Sauce Labs until we bump the Firefox version to 60.0, once it's supported by them, but it *does* fix the local failures + Travis CI builds.

   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   * Added support for plugins.

  * This introduces plugin hooks ``pypom_after_wait_for_page_to_load`` and
    ``pypom_after_wait_for_region_to_load``.
  * In order to take advantage of plugin support you must avoid implementing
    ``wait_for_page_to_load`` or ``wait_for_region_to_load`` in your page
    objects.
  * This was previously the only way to implement a custom wait for your pages
    and regions, but now means the calls to plugin hooks would be bypassed.
  * Custom waits can now be achieved by implementing a ``loaded`` property on

   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   * Added support for plugins.

  * This introduces plugin hooks ``pypom_after_wait_for_page_to_load`` and
    ``pypom_after_wait_for_region_to_load``.
  * In order to take advantage of plugin support you must avoid implementing
    ``wait_for_page_to_load`` or ``wait_for_region_to_load`` in your page
    objects.
  * This was previously the only way to implement a custom wait for your pages
    and regions, but now means the calls to plugin hooks would be bypassed.
  * Custom waits can now be achieved by implementing a ``loaded`` property on
    the page or region, which returns ``True`` when the page or region has
    finished loading.
  * See the user guide for more details.

* Any unused ``url_kwargs`` after formatting ``URL_TEMPLATE`` are added as URL
  query string parameters.

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.4.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Move import of ``doctest.UnexpectedException`` to top-level to avoid possible
>  errors when using ``--pdb``. (`1810
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1810&gt;`_)

>- Added printing of captured stdout/stderr before entering pdb, and improved a
>  test which was giving false negatives about output capturing. (`3052
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3052&gt;`_)

>- Fix ordering of tests using parametrized fixtures which can lead to fixtures
>  being created more than necessary. (`3161
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3161&gt;`_)

>- Fix bug where logging happening at hooks outside of &quot;test run&quot; hooks would
>  cause an internal error. (`3184
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3184&gt;`_)

>- Detect arguments injected by ``unittest.mock.patch`` decorator correctly when
>  pypi ``mock.patch`` is installed and imported. (`3206
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3206&gt;`_)

>- Errors shown when a ``pytest.raises()`` with ``match=`` fails are now cleaner
>  on what happened: When no exception was raised, the &quot;matching &#39;...&#39;&quot; part got
>  removed as it falsely implies that an exception was raised but it didn&#39;t
>  match. When a wrong exception was raised, it&#39;s now thrown (like
>  ``pytest.raised()`` without ``match=`` would) instead of complaining about
>  the unmatched text. (`3222
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3222&gt;`_)

>- Fixed output capture handling in doctests on macOS. (`985
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/985&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Add Sphinx parameter docs for ``match`` and ``message`` args to
>  ``pytest.raises``. (`3202
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3202&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- pytest has changed the publication procedure and is now being published to
>  PyPI directly from Travis. (`3060
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3060&gt;`_)

>- Rename ``ParameterSet._for_parameterize()`` to ``_for_parametrize()`` in
>  order to comply with the naming convention. (`3166
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3166&gt;`_)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.4.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- All pytest classes now subclass ``object`` for better Python 2/3 compatibility.
>  This should not affect user code except in very rare edge cases. (`2147
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147&gt;`_)


>Features
>--------

>- Introduce ``empty_parameter_set_mark`` ini option to select which mark to
>  apply when ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` is given an empty set of parameters.
>  Valid options are ``skip`` (default) and ``xfail``. Note that it is planned
>  to change the default to ``xfail`` in future releases as this is considered
>  less error prone. (`2527
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2527&gt;`_)

>- **Incompatible change**: after community feedback the `logging
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_ functionality has
>  undergone some changes. Please consult the `logging documentation
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.htmlincompatible-changes-in-pytest-3-4&gt;`_
>  for details. (`3013 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3013&gt;`_)

>- Console output falls back to &quot;classic&quot; mode when capturing is disabled (``-s``),
>  otherwise the output gets garbled to the point of being useless. (`3038
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3038&gt;`_)

>- New `pytest_runtest_logfinish
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_logfinish&gt;`_
>  hook which is called when a test item has finished executing, analogous to
>  `pytest_runtest_logstart
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_start&gt;`_.
>  (`3101 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3101&gt;`_)

>- Improve performance when collecting tests using many fixtures. (`3107
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3107&gt;`_)

>- New ``caplog.get_records(when)`` method which provides access to the captured
>  records for the ``&quot;setup&quot;``, ``&quot;call&quot;`` and ``&quot;teardown&quot;``
>  testing stages. (`3117 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3117&gt;`_)

>- New fixture ``record_xml_attribute`` that allows modifying and inserting
>  attributes on the ``&lt;testcase&gt;`` xml node in JUnit reports. (`3130
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3130&gt;`_)

>- The default cache directory has been renamed from ``.cache`` to
>  ``.pytest_cache`` after community feedback that the name ``.cache`` did not
>  make it clear that it was used by pytest. (`3138
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3138&gt;`_)

>- Colorize the levelname column in the live-log output. (`3142
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3142&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix hanging pexpect test on MacOS by using flush() instead of wait().
>  (`2022 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2022&gt;`_)

>- Fix restoring Python state after in-process pytest runs with the
>  ``pytester`` plugin; this may break tests using multiple inprocess
>  pytest runs if later ones depend on earlier ones leaking global interpreter
>  changes. (`3016 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3016&gt;`_)

>- Fix skipping plugin reporting hook when test aborted before plugin setup
>  hook. (`3074 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3074&gt;`_)

>- Fix progress percentage reported when tests fail during teardown. (`3088
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3088&gt;`_)

>- **Incompatible change**: ``-o/--override`` option no longer eats all the
>  remaining options, which can lead to surprising behavior: for example,
>  ``pytest -o foo=1 /path/to/test.py`` would fail because ``/path/to/test.py``
>  would be considered as part of the ``-o`` command-line argument. One
>  consequence of this is that now multiple configuration overrides need
>  multiple ``-o`` flags: ``pytest -o foo=1 -o bar=2``. (`3103
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3103&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Document hooks (defined with ``historic=True``) which cannot be used with
>  ``hookwrapper=True``. (`2423
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2423&gt;`_)

>- Clarify that warning capturing doesn&#39;t change the warning filter by default.
>  (`2457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2457&gt;`_)

>- Clarify a possible confusion when using pytest_fixture_setup with fixture
>  functions that return None. (`2698
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2698&gt;`_)

>- Fix the wording of a sentence on doctest flags used in pytest. (`3076
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3076&gt;`_)

>- Prefer ``https://*.readthedocs.io`` over ``http://*.rtfd.org`` for links in
>  the documentation. (`3092
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3092&gt;`_)

>- Improve readability (wording, grammar) of Getting Started guide (`3131
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3131&gt;`_)

>- Added note that calling pytest.main multiple times from the same process is
>  not recommended because of import caching. (`3143
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3143&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Show a simple and easy error when keyword expressions trigger a syntax error
>  (for example, ``&quot;-k foo and import&quot;`` will show an error that you can not use
>  the ``import`` keyword in expressions). (`2953
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2953&gt;`_)

>- Change parametrized automatic test id generation to use the ``__name__``
>  attribute of functions instead of the fallback argument name plus counter.
>  (`2976 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2976&gt;`_)

>- Replace py.std with stdlib imports. (`3067
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3067&gt;`_)

>- Corrected &#39;you&#39; to &#39;your&#39; in logging docs. (`3129
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3129&gt;`_)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.4.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- All pytest classes now subclass ``object`` for better Python 2/3 compatibility.
>  This should not affect user code except in very rare edge cases. (`2147
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147&gt;`_)


>Features
>--------

>- Introduce ``empty_parameter_set_mark`` ini option to select which mark to
>  apply when ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` is given an empty set of parameters.
>  Valid options are ``skip`` (default) and ``xfail``. Note that it is planned
>  to change the default to ``xfail`` in future releases as this is considered
>  less error prone. (`2527
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2527&gt;`_)

>- **Incompatible change**: after community feedback the `logging
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_ functionality has
>  undergone some changes. Please consult the `logging documentation
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.htmlincompatible-changes-in-pytest-3-4&gt;`_
>  for details. (`3013 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3013&gt;`_)

>- Console output falls back to &quot;classic&quot; mode when capturing is disabled (``-s``),
>  otherwise the output gets garbled to the point of being useless. (`3038
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3038&gt;`_)

>- New `pytest_runtest_logfinish
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_logfinish&gt;`_
>  hook which is called when a test item has finished executing, analogous to
>  `pytest_runtest_logstart
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_start&gt;`_.
>  (`3101 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3101&gt;`_)

>- Improve performance when collecting tests using many fixtures. (`3107
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3107&gt;`_)

>- New ``caplog.get_records(when)`` method which provides access to the captured
>  records for the ``&quot;setup&quot;``, ``&quot;call&quot;`` and ``&quot;teardown&quot;``
>  testing stages. (`3117 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3117&gt;`_)

>- New fixture ``record_xml_attribute`` that allows modifying and inserting
>  attributes on the ``&lt;testcase&gt;`` xml node in JUnit reports. (`3130
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3130&gt;`_)

>- The default cache directory has been renamed from ``.cache`` to
>  ``.pytest_cache`` after community feedback that the name ``.cache`` did not
>  make it clear that it was used by pytest. (`3138
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3138&gt;`_)

>- Colorize the levelname column in the live-log output. (`3142
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3142&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix hanging pexpect test on MacOS by using flush() instead of wait().
>  (`2022 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2022&gt;`_)

>- Fix restoring Python state after in-process pytest runs with the
>  ``pytester`` plugin; this may break tests using multiple inprocess
>  pytest runs if later ones depend on earlier ones leaking global interpreter
>  changes. (`3016 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3016&gt;`_)

>- Fix skipping plugin reporting hook when test aborted before plugin setup
>  hook. (`3074 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3074&gt;`_)

>- Fix progress percentage reported when tests fail during teardown. (`3088
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3088&gt;`_)

>- **Incompatible change**: ``-o/--override`` option no longer eats all the
>  remaining options, which can lead to surprising behavior: for example,
>  ``pytest -o foo=1 /path/to/test.py`` would fail because ``/path/to/test.py``
>  would be considered as part of the ``-o`` command-line argument. One
>  consequence of this is that now multiple configuration overrides need
>  multiple ``-o`` flags: ``pytest -o foo=1 -o bar=2``. (`3103
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3103&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Document hooks (defined with ``historic=True``) which cannot be used with
>  ``hookwrapper=True``. (`2423
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2423&gt;`_)

>- Clarify that warning capturing doesn&#39;t change the warning filter by default.
>  (`2457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2457&gt;`_)

>- Clarify a possible confusion when using pytest_fixture_setup with fixture
>  functions that return None. (`2698
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2698&gt;`_)

>- Fix the wording of a sentence on doctest flags used in pytest. (`3076
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3076&gt;`_)

>- Prefer ``https://*.readthedocs.io`` over ``http://*.rtfd.org`` for links in
>  the documentation. (`3092
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3092&gt;`_)

>- Improve readability (wording, grammar) of Getting Started guide (`3131
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3131&gt;`_)

>- Added note that calling pytest.main multiple times from the same process is
>  not recommended because of import caching. (`3143
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3143&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Show a simple and easy error when keyword expressions trigger a syntax error
>  (for example, ``&quot;-k foo and import&quot;`` will show an error that you can not use
>  the ``import`` keyword in expressions). (`2953
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2953&gt;`_)

>- Change parametrized automatic test id generation to use the ``__name__``
>  attribute of functions instead of the fallback argument name plus counter.
>  (`2976 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2976&gt;`_)

>- Replace py.std with stdlib imports. (`3067
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3067&gt;`_)

>- Corrected &#39;you&#39; to &#39;your&#39; in logging docs. (`3129
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3129&gt;`_)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.3.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions
>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on
>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we
>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users
>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)

>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the
>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2236
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2236&gt;`_)

>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken
>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal
>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)

>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack
>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)

>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it
>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>Features
>--------

>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``
>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available
>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and
>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``
>  declarations on functions. (`2267
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)

>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)

>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The
>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``
>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)

>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)

>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.
>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options
>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using
>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test
>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).
>  For more information, please see the `logging docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was
>  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog
>  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch
>  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the
>  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has
>  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)

>- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the
>  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)

>- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)

>- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and
>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2923
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2923&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2934
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2934&gt;`_)

>- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with
>  ``--doctest-modules``. (`502
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/502&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.
>  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)

>- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now
>  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the
>  original traceback. In python2 it will show the original traceback with a new
>  message that explains in which plugin. In python3 it will show 2 canonized
>  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an
>  exception that PyTest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)

>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)

>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to
>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)

>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its
>  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``
>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and
>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)

>- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being
>  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,
>  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation
>  for safety. (`2809 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2809&gt;`_)

>- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from
>  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (`2845
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2845&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which
>  should not be rewritten. (`2939
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2939&gt;`_)

>- Handle marks without description in ``pytest.ini``. (`2942
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2942&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- pytest now depends on `attrs &lt;https://pypi.org/project/attrs/&gt;`_ for internal
>  structures to ease code maintainability. (`2641
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2641&gt;`_)

>- Refactored internal Python 2/3 compatibility code to use ``six``. (`2642
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2642&gt;`_)

>- Stop vendoring ``pluggy`` - we&#39;re missing out on its latest changes for not
>  much benefit (`2719 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2719&gt;`_)

>- Internal refactor: simplify ascii string escaping by using the
>  backslashreplace error handler in newer Python 3 versions. (`2734
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2734&gt;`_)

>- Remove unnecessary mark evaluator in unittest plugin (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>- Calls to ``Metafunc.addcall`` now emit a deprecation warning. This function
>  is scheduled to be removed in ``pytest-4.0``. (`2876
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2876&gt;`_)

>- Internal move of the parameterset extraction to a more maintainable place.
>  (`2877 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2877&gt;`_)

>- Internal refactoring to simplify scope node lookup. (`2910
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2910&gt;`_)

>- Configure ``pytest`` to prevent pip from installing pytest in unsupported
>  Python versions. (`2922
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2922&gt;`_)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.3.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions
>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on
>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we
>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users
>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)

>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the
>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2236
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2236&gt;`_)

>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken
>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal
>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)

>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack
>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)

>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it
>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>Features
>--------

>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``
>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available
>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and
>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``
>  declarations on functions. (`2267
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)

>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)

>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The
>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``
>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)

>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)

>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.
>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options
>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using
>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test
>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).
>  For more information, please see the `logging docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was
>  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog
>  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch
>  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the
>  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has
>  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)

>- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the
>  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)

>- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)

>- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and
>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2923
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2923&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2934
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2934&gt;`_)

>- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with
>  ``--doctest-modules``. (`502
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/502&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.
>  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)

>  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the
>  original traceback. In python2 it will show the original traceback with a new
>  message that explains in which plugin. In python3 it will show 2 canonized
>  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an
>  exception that PyTest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)

>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)

>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to
>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)

>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its
>  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``
>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and
>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix decode error in Python 2 for doctests in docstrings. (`2434
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2434&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised during teardown by finalizers are now suppressed until all
>  finalizers are called, with the initial exception reraised. (`2440
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2440&gt;`_)

>- Fix incorrect &quot;collected items&quot; report when specifying tests on the command-
>  line. (`2464 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2464&gt;`_)

>- ``deprecated_call`` in context-manager form now captures deprecation warnings
>  even if the same warning has already been raised. Also, ``deprecated_call``
>  will always produce the same error message (previously it would produce
>  different messages in context-manager vs. function-call mode). (`2469
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2469&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue where paths collected by pytest could have triple leading ``/``
>  characters. (`2475 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2475&gt;`_)

>- Fix internal error when trying to detect the start of a recursive traceback.
>  (`2486 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2486&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly state for which hooks the calls stop after the first non-None
>  result. (`2493 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2493&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Create invoke tasks for updating the vendored packages. (`2474
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2474&gt;`_)

>- Update copyright dates in LICENSE, README.rst and in the documentation.

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.1.3

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix decode error in Python 2 for doctests in docstrings. (`2434
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2434&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised during teardown by finalizers are now suppressed until all
>  finalizers are called, with the initial exception reraised. (`2440
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2440&gt;`_)

>- Fix incorrect &quot;collected items&quot; report when specifying tests on the command-
>  line. (`2464 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2464&gt;`_)

>- ``deprecated_call`` in context-manager form now captures deprecation warnings
>  even if the same warning has already been raised. Also, ``deprecated_call``
>  will always produce the same error message (previously it would produce
>  different messages in context-manager vs. function-call mode). (`2469
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2469&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue where paths collected by pytest could have triple leading ``/``
>  characters. (`2475 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2475&gt;`_)

>- Fix internal error when trying to detect the start of a recursive traceback.
>  (`2486 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2486&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly state for which hooks the calls stop after the first non-None
>  result. (`2493 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2493&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Create invoke tasks for updating the vendored packages. (`2474
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2474&gt;`_)

>- Update copyright dates in LICENSE, README.rst and in the documentation.
>  (`2499 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2499&gt;`_)

>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.1.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
>  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
>  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
>  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (2430)

>- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (2434)

>- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (2436)

>- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
>  context manager form. (2441)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.7

>==================


>* Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules silently discarding
>  other modules when importing fails
>  Notably, importing the `anydbm` module is fixed. (`2248`_).
>  Thanks `pfhayes`_ for the PR.

>* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occured twice per testcase
>  element in the XML report. Thanks `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with ``--pdb``
>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.
>  
>* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`2238`_).
>  Thanks `sirex`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to `PEP-479`_ (`2160`_).
>  Thanks `tgoodlet`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
>  
>* Fix internal errors when an unprintable ``AssertionError`` is raised inside a test.

>* Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (`2231`_).
>  Thanks to `vidartf`_.

>* Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (`2281`_). Thanks `fbjorn`_ for the PR.

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.7

>==================


>* Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules silently discarding
>  other modules when importing fails
>  Notably, importing the `anydbm` module is fixed. (`2248`_).
>  Thanks `pfhayes`_ for the PR.

>* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occured twice per testcase
>  element in the XML report. Thanks `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with ``--pdb``
>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.
>  
>* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`2238`_).
>  Thanks `sirex`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to `PEP-479`_ (`2160`_).
>  Thanks `tgoodlet`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
>  
>* Fix internal errors when an unprintable ``AssertionError`` is raised inside a test.
>  Thanks `omerhadari`_ for the PR.

>* Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (`2231`_).
>  Thanks to `vidartf`_.

>* Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (`2281`_). Thanks `fbjorn`_ for the PR.

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
>  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
>  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks `barneygale`_ for the
>  PR.

### Changelog
> 
>### 1.8.0


>* **BREAKING CHANGE:** Moved cloud testing provider credentials into separate
>  files for improved security.

>  * If you are using the environment variables for specifying cloud testing
>    provider credentials, then you will not be affected.
>  * If you are storing credentials from any of the cloud testing providers in
>    one of the default configuration files then they will no longer be used.
>    These files are often checked into source code repositories, so it was
>    previously very easy to accidentally expose your credentials.
>  * Each cloud provider now has their own configuration file, such as
>    ``.browserstack``, ``.crossbrowsertesting``, ``.saucelabs``,
>    ``.testingbot`` and these can be located in the working directory or in the
>    user&#39;s home directory. This provides a convenient way to set up these files
>    globally, and override them for individual projects.
>  * To migrate, check ``pytest.ini``, ``tox.ini``, and ``setup.cfg`` for any
>    keys starting with ``browserstack_``, ``crossbrowsertesting_``,
>    ``saucelabs_``, or ``testingbot_``. If you find any, create a new
>    configuration file for the appropriate cloud testing provider with your
>    credentials, and remove the entries from the original file.
>  * The configuration keys can differ between cloud testing providers, so
>    please check the :doc:`user_guide` for details.
>  * See `60 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-selenium/issues/60&gt;`_ for
>    for original issue and related patch.

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.6.dev0

>=======================

>* pytest no longer generates ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version ``3.0.5`` (`2118`_).
>  Thanks to `nicoddemus`_ for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.



>* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (`2129`_).
>  Thanks to `malinoff`_ for the PR.

>* Plugins loaded by the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are now automatically
>  considered for assertion rewriting (`2185`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (`2150`_). The type(s) of the
>  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
>  error message. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR.

>* Fix ``pytester`` internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of
>  ``zope.interface`` (`1989`_). Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (`1920`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
>  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to `eli-b`_ for the PR.

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.5

>==================

>* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (`2105`_).
>  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to `mbukatov`_ for the report and
>  `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
>  and filenames, respectively (`2089`_ and `2078`_). Thanks to `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (`478`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (`687`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
>  Thanks to `dupuy`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``&quot;4 +- 4.0e-06&quot;``)
>  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
>  which can result in bugs such as `2111`_. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``±`` (for example ``4 ± 4.0e-06``).
>  Thanks `kerrick-lyft`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
>  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (`2034`_).
>  Thanks `nmundar`_ for the PR.

>* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (`2082`_).
>  Thanks `adler-j`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
>  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
>  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (`2016`_).
>  Thanks `d-b-w`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
>  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
>  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(`2103`_).
>  Thanks `jaraco`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (`2038`_). Thanks
>  `nedbat`_.

### pytest 3.0.4 -> 3.0.5

>### 3.0.5

>==================

>* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (`2105`_).
>  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to `mbukatov`_ for the report and
>  `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
>  and filenames, respectively (`2089`_ and `2078`_). Thanks to `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (`478`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (`687`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
>  Thanks to `dupuy`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``&quot;4 +- 4.0e-06&quot;``)
>  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
>  which can result in bugs such as `2111`_. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``±`` (for example ``4 ± 4.0e-06``).
>  Thanks `kerrick-lyft`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
>  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (`2034`_).
>  Thanks `nmundar`_ for the PR.

>* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (`2082`_).
>  Thanks `adler-j`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
>  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
>  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (`2016`_).
>  Thanks `d-b-w`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
>  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
>  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(`2103`_).
>  Thanks `jaraco`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (`2038`_). Thanks
>  `nedbat`_.

658,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fxapom/pulls/1,1,Initial version,"This is the initial version of FxAPOM. 

As can be seen from the readme, it includes a method for creating a FxA, as well as a helper which can be used to sign in via FxA.  I am looking for feedback on this before making the initial commit to Mozilla/master. I will also be releasing this as a PyPI package when it has passed review.

Note that this code is already being run in production by marketplace-tests and marketplace-tests-gaia, both pointing at my repo.
