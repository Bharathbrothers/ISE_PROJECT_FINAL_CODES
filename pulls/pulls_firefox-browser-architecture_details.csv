1,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/firefox-browser-architecture/pulls/77,77,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #76


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

@bgrins and I chatted about ways to do the conversion.

Then post that to the site, copy the rendered post and paste into mail client then set all fonts to 12px.""

In this case, I used [gd2md-html](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gd2md-html/igffnbdfnodiaphfmfaiiaegmoljbghf) to convert the Google Doc to Markdown. Then I copied the drawings into their own documents and used the ""Publish to the web…"" feature of Google Drive to publish them to publicly-accessible URLs that I embedded into the Markdown.

I considered exporting the drawings as SVGs, which should theoretically be small enough to be embedded into data: URLs. But Google converts the text to paths, which makes them quite a bit larger. Exported PNGs that are Base64-encoded are also larger than I'd want to embed in a Markdown file. The only other option I know about is to insert the images into a GitHub comment to save them in GitHub, which would be a reasonable alternative.

49,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/firefox-browser-architecture/pulls/46,46,fix indentation of list hierarchies,"Apparently child list items must be indented at least as much as their parent item's *text*, which is at least three spaces for numbered parent items, as those are prefixed with three characters: a number (f.e. ""1""), a period ("".""), and a space ("" "").

Thus two-space indentation of child items:

```
1. Foo
  * bar
  * baz
```

Fails to indent the children:

1. Foo
  * bar
  * baz

While three-space indentation:

```
1. Foo
   * bar
   * baz
```

Successfully indents the children:

1. Foo
   * bar
   * baz

Three spaces is arguably uglier than an even amount of indentation when editing the raw text (especially if your text editor assumes even indentation), so this change indents the children of numbered items by *four* characters and the children of bulleted items by *two* characters.

It also makes the bulleting characters more consistent, using an asterisk (*) for a first-level bulleted item, a dash (-) for a second-level item, and a plus sign (+) for a third-level item. (This doesn't affect appearance, as all three bulleting characters result in the same bullets, which vary only by level.)

This PR makes no textual changes. It is strictly formatting.
