The idea is to make it easy to include the `?service=foo` query parameter when signing an identity certificate.  You can pass it manually, or you can just pass in a `Session` object and let the oauth client do it for you.  The code here:

  https://github.com/kewisch/pyamo/blob/master/pyamo/utils.py#L67-L71

Would become just:

```
    session = client.login(username, password)
    oauth_client = fxa.oauth.Client(server_url=oauth_url)
    return oauth_client.authorize_code(session, scope, client_id)
```
