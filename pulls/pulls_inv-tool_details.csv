24,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/inv-tool/pulls/2,2,Add keyring support to inv-tool,"It's desirable to avoid storing LDAP credentials in plain text. This patch adds keyring support to inv-tool, akin to boto's, that allows you to store your password in the system keyring. See:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring

for more about the keyring bindings.

Instead of storing your credentials like this:

```
[authorization]
ldap_username = USERNAME
ldap_password = PASSWORD
```

Do this:

```
[authorization]
ldap_username = USERNAME
keyring = KEYRING_NAME
```

And to add your password to the keyring:

```
$ python
>>> import keyring
>>> keyring.set_password(KEYRING_NAME, USERNAME, PASSWORD)
```

NOTES:

The patch has some documentation change, but doesn't actually say explicitly how to set up the keyring (as this pull request does). The invtool.conf-dist provided looks to be a ""fill in these fields"" type example configuration file, while this would be of the ""do this instead of that"" variant. Anyway, docs may need to be updated to make the new functionality clearer.
