Two things:

* secrets with the `GITHUB_` are reserved, so I couldn't add `GITHUB_TOKEN`
* a new deploy key (with access limited to this repo; and accessible to any repo admin) seemed cleaner than generate a new repo scope oauth token, so I went that route

Next steps:

It's not quite what I had in mind, but with the current structure it's the best I could come up with in an hour.

I also factored out the results list into its own class. It was a bit weird that the client stored the results in itself and then modified itself with `extract_key()` and `flatten()`. I simply moved that to a separate class, so subsequent calls to the client don't overwrite the previous results.

The test is now working and passing, but it's terribly slow. I tried it for the dev account, and it makes some 3,000 API calls, so you get rate limited and the client waits and retries. When I limit it to 300 subscriptions, it returns quite quickly, but running it for all subscriptions takes ages.

If the general approach seems reasonable, at least as an incremental improvement over the current situation, I can factor out the changes in the client in a separate PR and clean them up a bit.

Changes:

* Add a pypi package with CLI bin cmd `frost` ... it doesn't do anything
  * subcommand `frost test` aliased to `pytest -s --debug-calls` run from the frost test root 
  * subcommand `frost list` to print out test file paths (since we default to ignoring all of them)
* Update the readme to use the `frost` command instead of docker (we never published the docker image and would have to mount tests in)
* fix the `awsci` make target to run aws tests

NB: **running tests via `pytest` is unchanged**

Caveats:

* heroku tests are blocked on being able to install the package: https://github.com/hwine/python-herokuadmintools/issues/1
* the test files still live outside the frost package directory

This should:

* provide a single entrypoint independent of pytest for future iteration
* make it easier to split out the fetching and caching functionality as separate subcommands or e.g. `make setup_gsuite` as a distinct subcommand
* provide a way to package and distribute tests without cloning this repo

However, unlike the short validMasterVersions the list in validNodeVersions is very long and goes all the way back to k8s 1.6. Thus, right now this does not actually test that the node version is up-to-date.

I initially thought to just check that the node version matched the master version, but realized this is not a good idea since google doesn't upgrade clusters and nodes in lockstep.

I have a doctest for the test itself, but have not functional tested that the resources change fetches the right data. 

We would need to add exemptions for current ELBs, but shouldn't need to for new ELBs.

Alternatively, we could change this to a negative test to make sure we're not running in `monitor` mode anywhere and not add exemptions for existing services.

   * pytest errors when the ids arg to parameterize throws an exception and the error is confusing when the parameters are an empty list as from our offline doctests. So change:

Goal is to reduce impact of differing versions of black between this repo's venv and developer tooling. We now use pre-commit to enforce consistency.
 - pinning of black version moves from requirements.txt to .pre-commit-config.yaml.
 - pre-commit is added to requirements.txt, and black removed
  - makefile targets modified to ensure pre-commit init is run.

> pytest 5.0.1 (2019-07-04)
> =========================
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#5479](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5479): Improve quoting in `raises` match failure message.
> -   [\#5523](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5523): Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example `-vs`) in Python 3.8+.
> -   [\#5547](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5547): `--step-wise` now handles `xfail(strict=True)` markers properly.
> 
> Improved Documentation
> ----------------------
> 
> -   [\#5517](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5517): Improve ""Declaring new hooks"" section in chapter ""Writing Plugins""
> 
> pytest 5.0.0 (2019-06-28)
> =========================
> 
> Important
> ---------
> 
> This release is a Python3.5+ only release.
> 
> For more details, see our [Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html).
> 
> Removals
> --------
> 
> -   [\#1149](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149): Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example typing `pytest --doctest-mod` inplace of `--doctest-modules`. This was previously allowed where the `ArgumentParser` thought it was unambiguous, but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins. See for example issues [\#1149](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149), [\#3413](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413), and [\#4009](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009).
> -   [\#5402](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402): **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**
> 
>     Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as possible, all warnings of type `PytestDeprecationWarning` now generate errors instead of warning messages.
> 
>     **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the [Deprecations and Removals](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html) section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.
> 
>     In the pytest `5.0.X` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop gap measure by adding this to your `pytest.ini` file:
> 
>     ``` {.sourceCode .ini}
>     [pytest]
>     filterwarnings =
>         ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning
>     ```
> 
>     But this will stop working when pytest `5.1` is released.
>

<summary>Changelog</summary>

*Sourced from [pytest's changelog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst).*

> pytest 5.0.0 (2019-06-28)
> =========================
> 
> Important
> ---------
> 
> This release is a Python3.5+ only release.
> 
> For more details, see our [Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/py27-py34-deprecation.html).
> 
> Removals
> --------
> 
> -   [\#1149](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149): Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example typing `pytest --doctest-mod` inplace of `--doctest-modules`. This was previously allowed where the `ArgumentParser` thought it was unambiguous, but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins. See for example issues [\#1149](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149), [\#3413](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413), and [\#4009](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009).
> -   [\#5402](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402): **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**
> 
>     Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as possible, all warnings of type `PytestDeprecationWarning` now generate errors instead of warning messages.
> 
>     **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the [Deprecations and Removals](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html) section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.
> 
>     In the pytest `5.0.X` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop gap measure by adding this to your `pytest.ini` file:
> 
>     ``` {.sourceCode .ini}
>     [pytest]
>     filterwarnings =
>         ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning
>     ```
> 
>     But this will stop working when pytest `5.1` is released.
> 
>     **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a comment to [\#5402](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5402).
> 
> -   [\#5412](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5412): `ExceptionInfo` objects (returned by `pytest.raises`) now have the same `str` representation as `repr`, which avoids some confusion when users use `print(e)` to inspect the object.
> 
> Deprecations
> ------------
> 
> -   [\#4488](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4488): The removal of the `--result-log` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.
> -   [\#466](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/466): The `funcargnames` attribute has been an alias for `fixturenames` since pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   [\#3457](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3457): New [pytest\_assertion\_pass](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#_pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertion_pass) hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.
> 
>     This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.
> 
> -   [\#5440](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5440): The [faulthandler](https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html) standard library module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.
> 
>     This functionality was provided by integrating the external [pytest-faulthandler](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler) plugin into the core, so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

Two issues:

1.  running the separate (semi-duplicate) doctest coverage yields errors
    with the new heroku/* code for unknown reasons. The extra run does
    not change the output any, per examination of prior passing travis
    runs[1].

2.  If you're a wacko who keeps multiple venvs around (for different
    python versions), the ""better"" approach to selecting files for the
    flake8 test is to only include python files we're going to commit.

Code previously only searched for metadata within test arguments that
were dictionaries.

For GitHub, the dictionary-of-arguements (aka funcargs) is where the
meta data lives. To convert scalar args to dictionaries would also
obfuscate paramertized name of the function call (a nice pytest feature,
imo).

Searching funcargs is done in addition to, and previous to, the search
into dictionaries. That way, if dictionaries are present, they will
override the scalar args."

*Sourced from [pytest's changelog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst).*

> pytest 4.5.0 (2019-05-11)
> =========================
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   [\#4826](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4826): A warning is now emitted when unknown marks are used as a decorator. This is often due to a typo, which can lead to silently broken tests.
> -   [\#4907](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4907): Show XFail reason as part of JUnitXML message field.
> -   [\#5013](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5013): Messages from crash reports are displayed within test summaries now, truncated to the terminal width.
> -   [\#5023](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5023): New flag `--strict-markers` that triggers an error when unknown markers (e.g. those not registered using the [markers option]() in the configuration file) are used in the test suite.
> 
>     The existing `--strict` option has the same behavior currently, but can be augmented in the future for additional checks.
> 
> -   [\#5026](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5026): Assertion failure messages for sequences and dicts contain the number of different items now.
> -   [\#5034](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5034): Improve reporting with `--lf` and `--ff` (run-last-failure).
> -   [\#5035](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5035): The `--cache-show` option/action accepts an optional glob to show only matching cache entries.
> -   [\#5059](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5059): Standard input (stdin) can be given to pytester's `Testdir.run()` and `Testdir.popen()`.
> -   [\#5068](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5068): The `-r` option learnt about `A` to display all reports (including passed ones) in the short test summary.
> -   [\#5108](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5108): The short test summary is displayed after passes with output (`-rP`).
> -   [\#5172](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5172): The `--last-failed` (`--lf`) option got smarter and will now skip entire files if all tests of that test file have passed in previous runs, greatly speeding up collection.
> -   [\#5177](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5177): Introduce new specific warning `PytestWarning` subclasses to make it easier to filter warnings based on the class, rather than on the message. The new subclasses are:
>     -   `PytestAssertRewriteWarning`
>     -   `PytestCacheWarning`
>     -   `PytestCollectionWarning`
>     -   `PytestConfigWarning`
>     -   `PytestUnhandledCoroutineWarning`
>     -   `PytestUnknownMarkWarning`
> -   [\#5202](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5202): New `record_testsuite_property` session-scoped fixture allows users to log `<property>` tags at the `testsuite` level with the `junitxml` plugin.
> 
>     The generated XML is compatible with the latest xunit standard, contrary to the properties recorded by `record_property` and `record_xml_attribute`.
> 
> -   [\#5214](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5214): The default logging format has been changed to improve readability. Here is an example of a previous logging message:
> 
>         test_log_cli_enabled_disabled.py    3 CRITICAL critical message logged by test
> 
>     This has now become:
> 
>         CRITICAL root:test_log_cli_enabled_disabled.py:3 critical message logged by test
> 
>     The formatting can be changed through the [log\_format](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#confval-log_format) configuration option.
> 
> -   [\#5220](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5220): `--fixtures` now also shows fixture scope for scopes other than `""function""`.
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#5113](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5113): Deselected items from plugins using `pytest_collect_modifyitems` as a hookwrapper are correctly reported now.
> -   [\#5144](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5144): With usage errors `exitstatus` is set to `EXIT_USAGEERROR` in the `pytest_sessionfinish` hook now as expected.
> -   [\#5235](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5235): `outcome.exit` is not used with `EOF` in the pdb wrapper anymore, but only with `quit`.

> =========================
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> -   [\#5089](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5089): Fix crash caused by error in `__repr__` function with both `showlocals` and verbose output enabled.
> -   [\#5139](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5139): Eliminate core dependency on 'terminal' plugin.
> -   [\#5229](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5229): Require `pluggy>=0.11.0` which reverts a dependency to `importlib-metadata` added in `0.10.0`. The `importlib-metadata` package cannot be imported when installed as an egg and causes issues when relying on `setup.py` to install test dependencies.
> 
> Improved Documentation
> ----------------------
>

> -   [\#5188](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5188): Improve help for `--runxfail` flag.

> =========================
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> -   [\#2224](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2224): `async` test functions are skipped and a warning is emitted when a suitable async plugin is not installed (such as `pytest-asyncio` or `pytest-trio`).

This may cause a series of problems and as the name makes clear, use at your own risk.
> -   [\#4718](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4718): The `-p` option can now be used to early-load plugins also by entry-point name, instead of just by module name.
> 
>     This makes it possible to early load external plugins like `pytest-cov` in the command-line:
> 
>         pytest -p pytest_cov
> 
> -   [\#4855](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4855): The `--pdbcls` option handles classes via module attributes now (e.g. `pdb:pdb.Pdb` with [pdb++]()), and its validation was improved.

> Bug Fixes
> ---------

> pytest 4.2.0 (2019-01-30)
> =========================
> 
> Features
> --------
> 
> - `#3094 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3094>`_: `Class xunit-style <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/xunit_setup.html>`__ functions and methods
>   now obey the scope of *autouse* fixtures.
> 
>   This fixes a number of surprising issues like ``setup_method`` being called before session-scoped
>   autouse fixtures (see `#517 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/517>`__ for an example).
> 
> 
> - `#4627 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4627>`_: Display a message at the end of the test session when running under Python 2.7 and 3.4 that pytest 5.0 will no longer
>   support those Python versions.
> 
> 
> - `#4660 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4660>`_: The number of *selected* tests now are also displayed when the ``-k`` or ``-m`` flags are used.
> 
> 
> - `#4688 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4688>`_: ``pytest_report_teststatus`` hook now can also receive a ``config`` parameter.
> 
> 
> - `#4691 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4691>`_: ``pytest_terminal_summary`` hook now can also receive a ``config`` parameter.
> 
> 
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> - `#3547 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3547>`_: ``--junitxml`` can emit XML compatible with Jenkins xUnit.
>   ``junit_family`` INI option accepts ``legacy|xunit1``, which produces old style output, and ``xunit2`` that conforms more strictly to https://github.com/jenkinsci/xunit-plugin/blob/xunit-2.3.2/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/xunit/types/model/xsd/junit-10.xsd
> 
> 
> - `#4280 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4280>`_: Improve quitting from pdb, especially with ``--trace``.
> 
>   Using ``q[quit]`` after ``pdb.set_trace()`` will quit pytest also.
> 
> 
> - `#4402 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4402>`_: Warning summary now groups warnings by message instead of by test id.
> 
>   This makes the output more compact and better conveys the general idea of how much code is
>   actually generating warnings, instead of how many tests call that code.
> 
> 
> - `#4536 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4536>`_: ``monkeypatch.delattr`` handles class descriptors like ``staticmethod``/``classmethod``.
> 
> 
> - `#4649 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4649>`_: Restore marks being considered keywords for keyword expressions.

> pytest 4.1.1 (2019-01-12)
> =========================
> 
> Bug Fixes
> ---------
> 
> - `#2256 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2256>`_: Show full repr with ``assert a==b`` and ``-vv``.
> 
> 
> - `#3456 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3456>`_: Extend Doctest-modules to ignore mock objects.
> 
> 
> - `#4617 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4617>`_: Fixed ``pytest.warns`` bug when context manager is reused (e.g. multiple parametrization).
> 
> 
> - `#4631 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4631>`_: Don't rewrite assertion when ``__getattr__`` is broken
> 
> 
> 
> Improved Documentation
> ----------------------
> 
> - `#3375 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3375>`_: Document that using ``setup.cfg`` may crash other tools or cause hard to track down problems because it uses a different parser than ``pytest.ini`` or ``tox.ini`` files.
> 
> 
> 
> Trivial/Internal Changes
> ------------------------
> 
> - `#4602 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4602>`_: Uninstall ``hypothesis`` in regen tox env.
> 
> 
> pytest 4.1.0 (2019-01-05)
> =========================
> 
> Removals
> --------
> 
> - `#2169 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2169>`_: ``pytest.mark.parametrize``: in previous versions, errors raised by id functions were suppressed and changed into warnings. Now the exceptions are propagated, along with a pytest message informing the node, parameter value and index where the exception occurred.
> 
> 
> - `#3078 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3078>`_: Remove legacy internal warnings system: ``config.warn``, ``Node.warn``. The ``pytest_logwarning`` now issues a warning when implemented.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#config-warn-and-node-warn>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3079 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3079>`_: Removed support for yield tests - they are fundamentally broken because they don't support fixtures properly since collection and test execution were separated.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#yield-tests>`__ on information on how to update your code.

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/google/google-api-python-client/compare/v1.6.4...v1.6.5)

Bugfix release

-   Proactively refresh credentials when applying and treat a missing
    `access_token` as invalid. Note: This change reveals surprising behavior
    between default credentials and batches. If you allow
    `googleapiclient.discovery.build` to use default credentials _and_ specify
    different credentials by providing `batch.execut()` with an explicit `http`
    argument, your individual requests will use the default credentials and

> pytest 4.1.0 (2019-01-05)
> =========================
> 
> Removals
> --------
> 
> - `#2169 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2169>`_: ``pytest.mark.parametrize``: in previous versions, errors raised by id functions were suppressed and changed into warnings. Now the exceptions are propagated, along with a pytest message informing the node, parameter value and index where the exception occurred.
> 
> 
> - `#3078 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3078>`_: Remove legacy internal warnings system: ``config.warn``, ``Node.warn``. The ``pytest_logwarning`` now issues a warning when implemented.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#config-warn-and-node-warn>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3079 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3079>`_: Removed support for yield tests - they are fundamentally broken because they don't support fixtures properly since collection and test execution were separated.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#yield-tests>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3082 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3082>`_: Removed support for applying marks directly to values in ``[**pytest**](https://github.com/pytest).mark.parametrize``. Use ``pytest.param`` instead.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#marks-in-pytest-mark-parametrize>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3083 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3083>`_: Removed ``Metafunc.addcall``. This was the predecessor mechanism to ``[**pytest**](https://github.com/pytest).mark.parametrize``.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#metafunc-addcall>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3085 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3085>`_: Removed support for passing strings to ``pytest.main``. Now, always pass a list of strings instead.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#passing-command-line-string-to-pytest-main>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#3086 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3086>`_: ``[pytest]`` section in **setup.cfg** files is not longer supported, use ``[tool:pytest]`` instead. ``setup.cfg`` files
>   are meant for use with ``distutils``, and a section named ``pytest`` has notoriously been a source of conflicts and bugs.
> 
>   Note that for **pytest.ini** and **tox.ini** files the section remains ``[pytest]``.
> 
> 
> - `#3616 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3616>`_: Removed the deprecated compat properties for ``node.Class/Function/Module`` - use ``pytest.Class/Function/Module`` now.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#internal-classes-accessed-through-node>`__ on information on how to update your code.
> 
> 
> - `#4421 <https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4421>`_: Removed the implementation of the ``pytest_namespace`` hook.
> 
>   See our `docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html#pytest-namespace>`__ on information on how to update your code.

    install it.

-   Make body optional for requests with no parameters. ([#&#8203;446](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/issues/446))

[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/compare/v1.6.5...v1.6.6)

### [`v1.6.5`](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/releases/v1.6.5)

[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/compare/v1.6.4...v1.6.5)

Bugfix release

-   Proactively refresh credentials when applying and treat a missing
    `access_token` as invalid. Note: This change reveals surprising behavior
    between default credentials and batches. If you allow
    `googleapiclient.discovery.build` to use default credentials _and_ specify
    different credentials by providing `batch.execut()` with an explicit `http`
    argument, your individual requests will use the default credentials and
    _not_ the credentials specified to the batch http. To avoid this, tell
    `build` explicitly not to use default credentials by specifying
    `build(..., http=httplib2.Http()`. ([#&#8203;469](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/issues/469))
-   Remove mutual exclusivity check for developerKey and credentials ([#&#8203;465](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/issues/465))
-   Handle unknown media length. ([#&#8203;406](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/issues/406))
-   Handle variant error format gracefully. ([#&#8203;459](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/issues/459))
-   Avoid testing against Django >= 2.0.0 on Python 2. ([#&#8203;460](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/issues/460))

### [`v1.7.0`](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/releases/v1.7.0)

[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/compare/v1.6.7...v1.7.0)

This release drops the hard requirement on oauth2client and installs
  google-auth by default instead. oauth2client is still supported but will
  need to be explicitly installed.

[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/compare/v1.6.6...v1.6.7)

Bugfix release

  **Note**: The next release of this library will no longer directly depend on

[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/compare/v1.6.4...v1.6.5)

Bugfix release

-   Proactively refresh credentials when applying and treat a missing
    `access_token` as invalid. Note: This change reveals surprising behavior
    between default credentials and batches. If you allow
    `googleapiclient.discovery.build` to use default credentials _and_ specify
    different credentials by providing `batch.execut()` with an explicit `http`
    argument, your individual requests will use the default credentials and
    _not_ the credentials specified to the batch http. To avoid this, tell
    `build` explicitly not to use default credentials by specifying
    `build(..., http=httplib2.Http()`. ([#&#8203;469](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/issues/469))
-   Remove mutual exclusivity check for developerKey and credentials ([#&#8203;465](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/issues/465))
-   Handle unknown media length. ([#&#8203;406](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/issues/406))
-   Handle variant error format gracefully. ([#&#8203;459](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/issues/459))
-   Avoid testing against Django >= 2.0.0 on Python 2. ([#&#8203;460](https://renovatebot.com/gh/google/google-api-python-client/issues/460))

Two issues:

1.  running the separate (semi-duplicate) doctest coverage yields errors
    with the new heroku/* code for unknown reasons. The extra run does
    not change the output any, per examination of prior passing travis
    runs[1].

2.  If you're a wacko who keeps multiple venvs around (for different
    python versions), the ""better"" approach to selecting files for the
    flake8 test is to only include python files we're going to commit.
