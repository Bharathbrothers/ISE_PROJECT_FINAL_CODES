Although we could (and probably should) get down to the precise reason (poor/missing ExplicitWait, etc.), this fix:

1. is a mere string change
2. greatly mitigates the failure condition, and helps get us closer to a passing prod suite
3. should also help a little bit with the test's performance/runtime
4. (still) passes on dev and staging

>### 2.16.3

>+++++++++++++++++++

>- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.



>### 2.16.2

>+++++++++++++++++++

>- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.

>No code modification (noted below) should be neccessary any longer.



>### 2.16.1

>+++++++++++++++++++

>- Restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
>- Bugfix for ``urllib3`` version parsing.

>**Note**: code that was written to import against the ``requests.packages``

>now.

>For example::

>    from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

### Changelog
> 
>### 2.14.0

>+++++++++++++

>**Improvements**

>- It is now possible to pass ``no_proxy`` as a key to the ``proxies``
>  dictionary to provide handling similar to the ``NO_PROXY`` environment
>  variable.
>- When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories
>  Requests now raises ``IOError``, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS
>  request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.
>- The behavior of ``SessionRedirectMixin`` was slightly altered.
>  ``resolve_redirects`` will now detect a redirect by calling
>  ``get_redirect_target(response)`` instead of directly
>  querying ``Response.is_redirect`` and ``Response.headers[&#39;location&#39;]``.
>  Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
>- Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have higher
>  resolution on Windows.
>- Added ``win_inet_pton`` as conditional dependency for the ``[socks]`` extra
>  on Windows with Python 2.7.
>- Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
>  check doesn&#39;t use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
>- URLs with schemes that begin with ``http`` but are not ``http`` or ``https``
>  no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

>**Bugfixes**

>- Much improved handling of non-ASCII ``Location`` header values in redirects.
>  Fewer ``UnicodeDecodeError``s are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now
>  correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.
>- If an attempt to ``seek`` file to find out its length fails, we now
>  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.
>- Restricted ``HTTPDigestAuth`` to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX
>  responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
>- Fixed some code that was firing ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python 3.6.
>- The dismayed person emoticon (``/o\\``) no longer has a big head. I&#39;m sure
>  this is what you were all worrying about most.


>**Miscellaneous**

>- Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
>- Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
>- Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
>- Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.7

>==================


>* Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules silently discarding
>  other modules when importing fails
>  Notably, importing the `anydbm` module is fixed. (`2248`_).
>  Thanks `pfhayes`_ for the PR.

>* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occured twice per testcase
>  element in the XML report. Thanks `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with ``--pdb``
>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.
>  
>* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`2238`_).
>  Thanks `sirex`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to `PEP-479`_ (`2160`_).
>  Thanks `tgoodlet`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
>  
>* Fix internal errors when an unprintable ``AssertionError`` is raised inside a test.
>  Thanks `omerhadari`_ for the PR.

>* Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (`2231`_).
>  Thanks to `vidartf`_.

>* Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (`2281`_). Thanks `fbjorn`_ for the PR.

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
>  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
>  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks `barneygale`_ for the
>  PR.

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.6.dev0

>=======================

>* pytest no longer generates ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version ``3.0.5`` (`2118`_).
>  Thanks to `nicoddemus`_ for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.



>* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (`2129`_).
>  Thanks to `malinoff`_ for the PR.

>* Plugins loaded by the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are now automatically
>  considered for assertion rewriting (`2185`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (`2150`_). The type(s) of the
>  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
>  error message. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR.

>* Fix ``pytester`` internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of
>  ``zope.interface`` (`1989`_). Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (`1920`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
>  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to `eli-b`_ for the PR.

This PR just maximizes the window at that point, but I wonder if it would be worthwhile to try to put the maximize somewhere that it would address all tests (in case it's needed elsewhere in the future).  If that's desired I can look into that, or perhaps we can merge this, to address the failures, and open an issue for the more extensive version.

1. Text needed to be converted to unicode for the asserts.  This is the failure I saw yesterday and why it's failing in Jenkins.

The main reason for the migration is the WD ability to run automated tests against the mobile version of our site. Also one of the things we gain when moving to WD is the ability to use native events.

Please comment on this pull request if you have questions or find issues in the code that we change.

**Our plan:**
- Everything we have been writing in AMO has been merged directly into the master branch.  We created an additional ""webdriver"" branch in the Addons-tests repository where we have changed the page objects over to the WebDriver syntax.  
- In order to maintain velocity, we are not using pull requests with the exception of using one merge the webdriver branch into master [Current step].  Activity can be easily monitored through commits: https://github.com/mozilla/Addon-Tests/commits/webdriver .  
- To maintain code quality and communication on the project, we are pair programming.
- New tests or changes have been logged and will be migrated to the webdriver branch manually. They can‚Äôt be cherry-picked because the RC/WD syntax differs too much.

**Known issues:**

From the [input migration](https://github.com/mozilla/input-tests/pull/102) pull made by @davehunt we have learned that:
- Native events don‚Äôt work on MAC
- Events are not fired when the window is not in focus and eventually those tests will fail
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=702605
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566671 
- WD requires element visibility to interact with it

**Summary of typical changes:**
- Removed methods and locators that are no longer needed in WebDriver
- WebDriver behaves differently with hidden elements, enabling is to remove is_element_visible methods from tests and concentrate on validating actual content. We removed many unnecessary test steps.
- Locators changed to WebDriver-style tuples containing the strategy and locator.
- Repeating region objects no longer need a count and singular property. All objects are returned, count is obtained using len, and individual items accessed using lookups.
- Page regions changed to use a root_element and then the region accessed in line with other WebQA webdriver projects.

**Other changes:**
- Removed the wait_for_element_visible, wait_for_element_present from the page object. Now using a combination of explicit and implicit waits.
- Explicit waits added where necessary but kept to a minimum:
  
  WebDriverWait(self.selenium, 10).until(lambda s: self.is_element_visible(*self._caption_locator))

- In order to maintain velocity, we are not using pull requests with the exception of using one merge the webdriver branch into master [Current step].  Activity can be easily monitored through commits: https://github.com/mozilla/Addon-Tests/commits/webdriver .  
- To maintain code quality and communication on the project, we are pair programming.
- New tests or changes have been logged and will be migrated to the webdriver branch manually. They can‚Äôt be cherry-picked because the RC/WD syntax differs too much.

**Known issues:**

From the [input migration](https://github.com/mozilla/input-tests/pull/102) pull made by @davehunt we have learned that:
- Native events don‚Äôt work on MAC
- Events are not fired when the window is not in focus and eventually those tests will fail
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=702605
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566671 
- WD requires element visibility to interact with it

**Summary of typical changes:**
- Removed methods and locators that are no longer needed in WebDriver
- WebDriver behaves differently with hidden elements, enabling is to remove is_element_visible methods from tests and concentrate on validating actual content. We removed many unnecessary test steps.
- Locators changed to WebDriver-style tuples containing the strategy and locator.
- Repeating region objects no longer need a count and singular property. All objects are returned, count is obtained using len, and individual items accessed using lookups.
- Page regions changed to use a root_element and then the region accessed in line with other WebQA webdriver projects.

**Other changes:**
- Removed the wait_for_element_visible, wait_for_element_present from the page object. Now using a combination of explicit and implicit waits.
- Explicit waits added where necessary but kept to a minimum:

1853,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/Addon-Tests/pulls/237,237,Migrate to WebDriver API,"This pull request covers the migration to WebDriver (WD) API.
The main reason for the migration is the WD ability to run automated tests against the mobile version of our site. Also one of the things we gain when moving to WD is the ability to use native events.

Please comment on this pull request if you have questions or find issues in the code that we change.

**Our plan:**
- Everything we have been writing in AMO has been merged directly into the master branch.  We created an additional ""webdriver"" branch in the Addons-tests repository where we have changed the page objects over to the WebDriver syntax.  
- In order to maintain velocity, we are not using pull requests with the exception of using one merge the webdriver branch into master [Current step].  Activity can be easily monitored through commits: https://github.com/mozilla/Addon-Tests/commits/webdriver .  
- To maintain code quality and communication on the project, we are pair programming.
- New tests or changes have been logged and will be migrated to the webdriver branch manually. They can‚Äôt be cherry-picked because the RC/WD syntax differs too much.

**Known issues:**

From the [input migration](https://github.com/mozilla/input-tests/pull/102) pull made by @davehunt we have learned that:
- Native events don‚Äôt work on MAC
- Events are not fired when the window is not in focus and eventually those tests will fail

  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566671 
- WD requires element visibility to interact with it

**Summary of typical changes:**
- Removed methods and locators that are no longer needed in WebDriver
- WebDriver behaves differently with hidden elements, enabling is to remove is_element_visible methods from tests and concentrate on validating actual content. We removed many unnecessary test steps.
- Locators changed to WebDriver-style tuples containing the strategy and locator.
- Repeating region objects no longer need a count and singular property. All objects are returned, count is obtained using len, and individual items accessed using lookups.
- Page regions changed to use a root_element and then the region accessed in line with other WebQA webdriver projects.

**Other changes:**
- Removed the wait_for_element_visible, wait_for_element_present from the page object. Now using a combination of explicit and implicit waits.

- New tests or changes have been logged and will be migrated to the webdriver branch manually. They can‚Äôt be cherry-picked because the RC/WD syntax differs too much.

**Known issues:**

From the [input migration](https://github.com/mozilla/input-tests/pull/102) pull made by @davehunt we have learned that:
- Native events don‚Äôt work on MAC
- Events are not fired when the window is not in focus and eventually those tests will fail
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=702605
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566671 
- WD requires element visibility to interact with it

**Summary of typical changes:**
- Removed methods and locators that are no longer needed in WebDriver
- WebDriver behaves differently with hidden elements, enabling is to remove is_element_visible methods from tests and concentrate on validating actual content. We removed many unnecessary test steps.
- Locators changed to WebDriver-style tuples containing the strategy and locator.
- Repeating region objects no longer need a count and singular property. All objects are returned, count is obtained using len, and individual items accessed using lookups.
- Page regions changed to use a root_element and then the region accessed in line with other WebQA webdriver projects.

**Other changes:**
- Removed the wait_for_element_visible, wait_for_element_present from the page object. Now using a combination of explicit and implicit waits.
- Explicit waits added where necessary but kept to a minimum:
