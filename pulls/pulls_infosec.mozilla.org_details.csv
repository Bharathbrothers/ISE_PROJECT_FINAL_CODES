It does *not* prevent a page from appearing in Google or Bing.

## Robots.txt does not, I repeat again, NOT prevent a page from being in search engines

Indeed, as indicated in these changes, if you want an item to get out of search engines, that page should *not* be in robots.txt, so that Google and Bing can *explicitly* crawl it. If you want to really go wild, you should also:

 - Include the page in sitemaps.xml (encouraging crawlers further)
 - Block your sitemaps.xml from being indexed (preventing the URL from being disclosed that way). I added this change to Django. 

And, when you change a page from being public to being private by way of the robots meta or HTTP tag, you should also:

 - Add it to robots.txt for a day so that it immediately gets removed
 - A day or so later, encourage Google and Bing to re-crawl the page so they pick up the new tags

As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.
