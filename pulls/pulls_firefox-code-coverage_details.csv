   ### 41.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 479: Remove some usage of the deprecated ``imp`` module.

   ### 41.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 1697: Moved most of the constants from setup.py to setup.cfg
* 1749: Fixed issue with the PEP 517 backend where building a source distribution would fail if any tarball existed in the destination directory.
* 1750: Fixed an issue with PEP 517 backend where wheel builds would fail if the destination directory did not already exist.
* 1756: Forse metadata-version &gt;= 1.2. when project urls are present.
* 1769: Improve ``package_data`` check: ensure the dictionary values are lists/tuples of strings.
* 1788: Changed compatibility fallback logic for ``html.unescape`` to avoid accessing ``HTMLParser.unescape`` when not necessary. ``HTMLParser.unescape`` is deprecated and will be removed in Python 3.9.

   ```
   -------

* 1735: When parsing setup.cfg files, setuptools now requires the files to be encoded as UTF-8. Any other encoding will lead to a UnicodeDecodeError. This change removes support for specifying an encoding using a &#39;coding: &#39; directive in the header of the file, a feature that was introduces in 40.7. Given the recent release of the aforementioned feature, it is assumed that few if any projects are utilizing the feature to specify an encoding other than UTF-8.

  text when the ``Version:`` header can&#39;t be found.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 40.8.0
   ```
   -------

* 1652: Added the ``build_meta:__legacy__`` backend, a &quot;compatibility mode&quot; PEP 517 backend that can be used as the default when ``build-backend`` is left unspecified in ``pyproject.toml``.
* 1635: Resource paths are passed to ``pkg_resources.resource_string`` and similar no longer accept paths that traverse parents, that begin with a leading ``/``. Violations of this expectation raise DeprecationWarnings and will become errors. Additionally, any paths that are absolute on Windows are strictly disallowed and will raise ValueErrors.
* 1536: ``setuptools`` will now automatically include licenses if ``setup.cfg`` contains a ``license_file`` attribute, unless this file is manually excluded inside ``MANIFEST.in``.

* 1554: ``build_meta.build_sdist`` now includes ``setup.py`` in source distributions by default.
* 1576: Started monkey-patching ``get_metadata_version`` and ``read_pkg_file`` onto ``distutils.DistributionMetadata`` to retain the correct version on the ``PKG-INFO`` file in the (deprecated) ``upload`` command.
* 1533: Restricted the ``recursive-include setuptools/_vendor`` to contain only .py and .txt files.
* 1395: Changed Pyrex references to Cython in the documentation.
* 1456: Documented that the ``rpmbuild`` packages is required for the ``bdist_rpm`` command.

* 1539: Added minimum version column in ``setup.cfg`` metadata table.
* 1552: Fixed a minor typo in the python 2/3 compatibility documentation.
* 1553: Updated installation instructions to point to ``pip install`` instead of ``ez_setup.py``.
* 1560: Updated ``setuptools`` distribution documentation to remove some outdated information.
* 1564: Documented ``setup.cfg`` minimum version for version and project_urls.

  (See also `GitLab257`_)

- Fix another bug around SyntaxErrors not being reported at the right column
  and row (See also `GitLab259`_ and `GitLab237`_ for a related, previously

   ### 3.1.1
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.1 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Do not attempt to install/distribute a ``man`` file with the Python package;
  leave this for others to do. (See also `GitLab254`_)

- Fix packaging bug where wheel version constraints specified in setup.cfg did
  not match the constraints in setup.py. (See also `GitLab255`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.1.0
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.0 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Add ``--bug-report`` flag to make issue reporters&#39; lives easier.

- Collect configuration files from the current directory when using our Git
  hook. (See also `GitLab210`_, `GitLab218`_, `GitLab223`_)

- Avoid unhandled exceptions when dealing with SyntaxErrors. (See also
  `GitLab214`_, `GitLab238`_)

- Exit early if the value for ``--diff`` is empty. (See also `GitLab226`_)

- Handle empty ``--stdin-display-name`` values. (See also `GitLab235`_)

- Properly report the column number of Syntax Errors. We were assuming that
  all reports of column numbers were 0-indexed, however, SyntaxErrors report
  the column number as 1-indexed. This caused us to report a column number
  that was 1 past the actual position. Further, when combined with
  SyntaxErrors that occur at a newline, this caused the position to be
  visually off by two. (See also `GitLab237`_)

- Fix the behaviour of ``--enable-extensions``. Previously, items specified
  here were still ignored due to the fact that the off-by-default extension
  codes were being left in the ``ignore`` list. (See also `GitLab239`_)

- Fix problems around ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` behaviour that prevented
  codes that were neither explicitly selected nor explicitly ignored from
  being reported. (See also `GitLab242`_)

- Truly be quiet when the user specifies ``-q`` one or more times. Previously,
  we were showing the if the user specified ``-q`` and ``--show-source``. We
  have fixed this bug. (See also `GitLab245`_)

- Add new File Processor attribute, ``previous_unindented_logical_line`` to
  accommodate pycodestyle 2.1.0. (See also `GitLab246`_)

- When something goes wrong, exit non-zero. (See also `GitLab248`_,
  `GitLab209`_)

- Add ``--tee`` as an option to allow use of ``--output-file`` and printing to
  standard out.

- Allow the git plugin to actually be lazy when collecting files.

- Allow for pycodestyle 2.1 series and pyflakes 1.3 series.

   ### 3.0.4
   ```
   -------------------

- Side-step a Pickling Error when using Flake8 with multiprocessing on Unix
  systems. (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix an Attribute Error raised when dealing with Invalid Syntax. (See also
  `GitLab203`_)

- Fix an unhandled Syntax Error when tokenizing files. (See also
  `GitLab205`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.3
   ```
   -------------------

- Disable ``--jobs`` for any version of Python on Windows.
  (See also `this Python bug report`_)

- Raise exception when entry_point in plugin not callable.
  This raises an informative error when a plugin fails to load because its
  entry_point is not callable, which can happen with a plugin which is buggy or
  not updated for the current version of flake8. This is nicer than raising a
  `PicklingError` about failing to pickle a module (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix `` noqa`` comments followed by a ``:`` and explanation broken by
  3.0.0 (See also `GitLab178`_)

- Always open our output file in append mode so we do not overwrite log
  messages. (See also `GitLab193`_)

- When normalizing path values read from configuration, keep in context the
  directory where the configuration was found so that relative paths work.
  (See also `GitLab194`_)

- Fix issue where users were unable to ignore plugin errors that were on
  by default. (See also `GitLab195`_)

- Fix our legacy API StyleGuide&#39;s ``init_report`` method to actually override
  the previous formatter. (See also `GitLab200`_)

   ### 3.0.2
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix local config file discovery.  (See also `GitLab181`_)

- Fix indexing of column numbers. We accidentally were starting column indices
  at 0 instead of 1.

- Fix regression in handling of errors like E402 that rely on a combination of
  attributes. (See also `GitLab186`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.1
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix regression in handling of `` noqa`` for multiline strings.
  (See also `GitLab177`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--output-file`` when not also using
  ``--verbose``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--quiet``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--statistics``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

    https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/177
.. _GitLab180:
    https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/180
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   -------------------

- Rewrite our documentation from scratch! (http://flake8.pycqa.org)

- Drop explicit support for Pythons 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3.

- Remove dependence on pep8/pycodestyle for file processing, plugin
  dispatching, and more. We now control all of this while keeping backwards
  compatibility.

- ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` can now both be specified and try to find the
  most specific rule from each. For example, if you do ``--select E --ignore
  E123`` then we will report everything that starts with ``E`` except for
  ``E123``. Previously, you would have had to do ``--ignore E123,F,W`` which
  will also still work, but the former should be far more intuitive.

- Add support for in-line `` noqa`` comments to specify **only** the error
  codes to be ignored, e.g., `` noqa: E123,W503``

- Add entry-point for formatters as well as a base class that new formatters
  can inherit from. See the documentation for more details.

- Add detailed verbose output using the standard library logging module.

- Enhance our usage of optparse for plugin developers by adding new parameters
  to the ``add_option`` that plugins use to register new options.

- Update ``--install-hook`` to require the name of version control system hook
  you wish to install a Flake8.

- Stop checking sub-directories more than once via the setuptools command

- When passing a file on standard-in, allow the caller to specify
  ``--stdin-display-name`` so the output is properly formatted

- The Git hook now uses ``sys.executable`` to format the shebang line.
  This allows Flake8 to install a hook script from a virtualenv that points to
  that virtualenv&#39;s Flake8 as opposed to a global one (without the virtualenv
  being sourced).

- Print results in a deterministic and consistent ordering when used with
  multiprocessing

- When using ``--count``, the output is no longer written to stderr.

- AST plugins can either be functions or classes and all plugins can now
  register options so long as there are callable attributes named as we
  expect.

- Stop forcibly re-adding ``.tox``, ``.eggs``, and ``*.eggs`` to
  ``--exclude``. Flake8 2.x started always appending those three patterns
  to any exclude list (including the default and any user supplied list).
  Flake8 3 has stopped adding these in, so you may see errors when upgrading
  due to these patterns no longer being forcibly excluded by default if you
  have your own exclude patterns specified.

  To fix this, add the appropriate patterns to your exclude patterns list.

  .. note::

      This item was added in November of 2016, as a result of a bug
      report.

  exclusive options to flake8. (`GitLab8`_, `GitLab!18`_)

- **Feature** Allow git hook configuration to live in ``.git/config``.
  See the updated `VCS hooks docs`_ for more details. (`GitLab!20`_)

  instead.
- Wheel now supports setuptools style conditional requirements via the
  extras_require={} syntax. Separate &#39;extra&#39; names from conditions using
  the : character. Wheel&#39;s own setup.py does this. (The empty-string
  extra is the same as install_requires.) These conditional requirements
  should work the same whether the package is installed by wheel or
  by setup.py.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.23.0
   ```
   ======
- Compatibility tag flags added to the bdist_wheel command
- sdist should include files necessary for tests
- &#39;wheel convert&#39; can now also convert unpacked eggs to wheel
- Rename pydist.json to metadata.json to avoid stepping on the PEP
- The --skip-scripts option has been removed, and not generating scripts is now
  the default. The option was a temporary approach until installers could
  generate scripts themselves. That is now the case with pip 1.5 and later.
  Note that using pip 1.4 to install a wheel without scripts will leave the
  installation without entry-point wrappers. The &quot;wheel install-scripts&quot;
  command can be used to generate the scripts in such cases.
- Thank you contributors
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.22.0
   ```
   ======
- Include entry_points.txt, scripts a.k.a. commands, in experimental
  pydist.json
- Improved test_requires parsing
- Python 2.6 fixes, &quot;wheel version&quot; command courtesy pombredanne
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.21.0
   ```
   ======
- Pregenerated scripts are the default again.
- &quot;setup.py bdist_wheel --skip-scripts&quot; turns them off.
- setuptools is no longer a listed requirement for the &#39;wheel&#39;
  package. It is of course still required in order for bdist_wheel
  to work.
- &quot;python -m wheel&quot; avoids importing pkg_resources until it&#39;s necessary.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.20.0
   ```
   ======
- No longer include console_scripts in wheels. Ordinary scripts (shell files,
  standalone Python files) are included as usual.
- Include new command &quot;python -m wheel install-scripts [distribution
  [distribution ...]]&quot; to install the console_scripts (setuptools-style
  scripts using pkg_resources) for a distribution.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.19.0
   ```
   ======
- pymeta.json becomes pydist.json

   ### 0.14.0
   ```
   ======
- Changed the signature format to better comply with the current JWS spec.
  Breaks all existing signatures.
- Include ``wheel unsign`` command to remove RECORD.jws from an archive.
- Put the description in the newly allowed payload section of PKG-INFO
  (METADATA) files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.13.0
   ```
   ======
- Use distutils instead of sysconfig to get installation paths; can install
  headers.

- Allow bootstrap installs without any pkg_resources.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.12.0

   ======
- Include a copy of pkg_resources. Wheel can now install into a virtualenv
  that does not have distribute (though most packages still require
  pkg_resources to actually work; wheel install distribute)
- Define a new setup.cfg section [wheel]. universal=1 will
  apply the py2.py3-none-any tag for pure python wheels.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.7
   ```
   =====
- Only import dirspec when needed. dirspec is only needed to find the
  configuration for keygen/signing operations.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.6
   ```
   =====
- requires-dist from setup.cfg overwrites any requirements from setup.py
  Care must be taken that the requirements are the same in both cases,
  or just always install from wheel.

- improved command line utility, adds &#39;wheel convert [egg or wininst]&#39; to
  convert legacy binary formats to wheel
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.5
   ```
   =====
- Wheel&#39;s own wheel file can be executed by Python, and can install itself:
  ``python wheel-0.9.5-py27-none-any/wheel install ...``
- Use argparse; basic ``wheel install`` command should run with only stdlib
  dependencies.
- Allow requires_dist in setup.cfg&#39;s [metadata] section. In addition to
  dependencies in setup.py, but will only be interpreted when installing
  from wheel, not from sdist. Can be qualified with environment markers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.4
   ```
   =====
- Fix wheel.signatures in sdist
   ```

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.2
   ```
   =====
- Automatic signing if WHEEL_TOOL points to the wheel binary
- Even more Python 3 fixes
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.1
   ```
   =====
- &#39;wheel sign&#39; uses the keys generated by &#39;wheel keygen&#39; (instead of generating
  a new key at random each time)
- Python 2/3 encoding/decoding fixes
- Run tests on Python 2.6 (without signature verification)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9

   ```
   -------

* 1285: Fixed RuntimeError in pkg_resources.parse_requirements

  unordered sequences (sets or dicts).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 37.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 878: Drop support for Python 2.6. Python 2.6 users should

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 1075: Add new ``Description-Content-Type`` metadata field. `See here for
  documentation on how to use this field.
  &lt;https://packaging.python.org/specifications/description-content-type&gt;`_

* 1068: Sort files and directories when building eggs for
  deterministic order.

  Fixes issue where ``pytest-runner-N.N`` would satisfy the installation
  of ``pytest``.

* 1129: Fix working set dependencies handling when replacing conflicting
  distributions (e.g. when using ``setup_requires`` with a conflicting
  transitive dependency, fix 1124).

* 1133: Improved handling of README files extensions and added
  Markdown to the list of searched READMES.

* 1135: Improve performance of pkg_resources import by not invoking
  ``access`` or ``stat`` and using ``os.listdir`` instead.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 1131: Make possible using several files within ``file:`` directive

   ### 36.2.7
   ```
   -------

* fix 1105: Fix handling of requirements with environment
  markers when declared in ``setup.cfg`` (same treatment as
  for 1081).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.6
   ```
   -------

* 462: Don&#39;t assume a directory is an egg by the ``.egg``
  extension alone.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.5
   ```

* 1112, 1091, 1115: Now using Trusty containers in
  Travis for CI and CD.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.4
   ```
   -------

* 1092: ``pkg_resources`` now uses ``inspect.getmro`` to
  resolve classes in method resolution order.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.3
   ```
   -------

* 1102: Restore behavior for empty extras.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.2
   ```
   -------

* 1099: Revert commit a3ec721, restoring intended purpose of
  extras as part of a requirement declaration.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.1
   ```
   -------

* fix 1086
* fix 1087
* support extras specifiers in install_requires requirements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 1081: Environment markers indicated in ``install_requires``
  are now processed and treated as nameless ``extras_require``
  with markers, allowing their metadata in requires.txt to be
  correctly generated.

* 1053: Tagged commits are now released using Travis-CI
  build stages, meaning releases depend on passing tests on
  all supported Python versions (Linux) and not just the latest
  Python version.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Correct ``py31compat.makedirs`` to correctly honor
  ``exist_ok`` parameter.
* 1083: Also use makedirs compatibility throughout setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Avoid race condition on directory creation in
  ``pkg_resources.ensure_directory``.

* Removed deprecation of and restored support for
  ``upload_docs`` command for sites other than PyPI.
  Only warehouse is dropping support, but services like
  `devpi &lt;http://doc.devpi.net/latest/&gt;`_ continue to
  support docs built by setuptools&#39; plugins. See
  `this comment &lt;https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/devpi/issues/388/support-rtd-model-for-building-uploadingcomment-34292423&gt;`_
  for more context on the motivation for this change.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 1042: Fix import in py27compat module that still
  referenced six directly, rather than through the externs
  module (vendored packages hook).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 980 and others: Once again, Setuptools vendors all
  of its dependencies. It seems to be the case that in
  the Python ecosystem, all build tools must run without
  any dependencies (build, runtime, or otherwise). At
  such a point that a mechanism exists that allows
  build tools to have dependencies, Setuptools will adopt
  it.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 1015: Fix test failures on Python 3.7.

* 1024: Add workaround for Jython 2581 in monkey module.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 992: Revert change introduced in v34.4.1, now
  considered invalid.

* 1016: Revert change introduced in v35.0.0 per 1014,
  referencing 436. The approach had unintended
  consequences, causing sdist installs to be missing
  files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 436: In egg_info.manifest_maker, no longer read
  the file list from the manifest file, and instead
  re-build it on each build. In this way, files removed
  from the specification will not linger in the manifest.
  As a result, any files manually added to the manifest
  will be removed on subsequent egg_info invocations.
  No projects should be manually adding files to the
  manifest and should instead use MANIFEST.in or SCM
  file finders to force inclusion of files in the manifest.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.1
   ```
   -------

* 1008: In MSVC support, use always the last version available for Windows SDK and UCRT SDK.

* 1008: In MSVC support, fix &quot;vcruntime140.dll&quot; returned path with Visual Studio 2017.

* 992: In msvc.msvc9_query_vcvarsall, ensure the
  returned dicts have str values and not Unicode for
  compatibility with os.environ.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 995: In MSVC support, add support for &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio 2017&quot; and &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools 2017&quot;.

* 999 via 1007: Extend support for declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file to include the options
  ``python_requires`` and ``py_modules``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.3
   ```
   -------

* 967 (and 997): Explicitly import submodules of
  packaging to account for environments where the imports
  of those submodules is not implied by other behavior.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.2
   ```
   -------

* 993: Fix documentation upload by correcting
  rendering of content-type in _build_multipart
  on Python 3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 988: Trap ``os.unlink`` same as ``os.remove`` in
  ``auto_chmod`` error handler.

* 983: Fixes to invalid escape sequence deprecations on
  Python 3.6.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 941: In the upload command, if the username is blank,
  default to ``getpass.getuser()``.

* 971: Correct distutils findall monkeypatch to match
  appropriate versions (namely Python 3.4.6).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 966: Add support for reading dist-info metadata and
  thus locating Distributions from zip files.

* 968: Allow &#39;+&#39; and &#39;!&#39; in egg fragments
  so that it can take package names that contain
  PEP 440 conforming version specifiers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 953: More aggressively employ the compatibility issue
  originally added in 706.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 930: ``build_info`` now accepts two new parameters
  to optimize and customize the building of C libraries.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.3
   ```
   -------

* 947: Loosen restriction on the version of six required,
  restoring compatibility with environments relying on
  six 1.6.0 and later.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 882: Ensure extras are honored when building the
  working set.
* 913: Fix issue in develop if package directory has
  a trailing slash.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 935: Fix glob syntax in graft.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 581: Instead of vendoring the growing list of
  dependencies that Setuptools requires to function,
  Setuptools now requires these dependencies just like
  any other project. Unlike other projects, however,
  Setuptools cannot rely on ``setup_requires`` to
  demand the dependencies it needs to install because
  its own machinery would be necessary to pull those
  dependencies if not present (a bootstrapping problem).
  As a result, Setuptools no longer supports self upgrade or
  installation in the general case. Instead, users are
  directed to use pip to install and upgrade using the
  ``wheel`` distributions of setuptools.

  Users are welcome to contrive other means to install
  or upgrade Setuptools using other means, such as
  pre-installing the Setuptools dependencies with pip
  or a bespoke bootstrap tool, but such usage is not
  recommended and is not supported.

  As discovered in 940, not all versions of pip will
  successfully install Setuptools from its pre-built
  wheel. If you encounter issues with &quot;No module named
  six&quot; or &quot;No module named packaging&quot;, especially
  following a line &quot;Running setup.py egg_info for package
  setuptools&quot;, then your pip is not new enough.

  There&#39;s an additional issue in pip where setuptools
  is upgraded concurrently with other source packages,
  described in pip 4253. The proposed workaround is to
  always upgrade Setuptools first prior to upgrading
  other packages that would upgrade Setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 921: Correct issue where certifi fallback not being
  reached on Windows.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.0
   ```
   -------

Installation via pip, as indicated in the `Python Packaging
User&#39;s Guide &lt;https://packaging.python.org/installing/&gt;`_,
is the officially-supported mechanism for installing
Setuptools, and this recommendation is now explicit in the
much more concise README.

Other edits and tweaks were made to the documentation. The
codebase is unchanged.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 619: Removed support for the ``tag_svn_revision``
  distribution option. If Subversion tagging support is
  still desired, consider adding the functionality to
  setuptools_svn in setuptools_svn 2.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 866: Use ``dis.Bytecode`` on Python 3.4 and later in
  ``setuptools.depends``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 889: Backport proposed fix for disabling interpolation in
  distutils.Distribution.parse_config_files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 884: Restore support for running the tests under
  `pytest-runner &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner&gt;`_
  by ensuring that PYTHONPATH is honored in tests invoking
  a subprocess.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.3
   ```
   -------

* 706: Add rmtree compatibility shim for environments where
  rmtree fails when passed a unicode string.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.2
   ```
   -------

* 893: Only release sdist in zip format as warehouse now
  disallows releasing two different formats.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 704: More selectively ensure that &#39;rmtree&#39; is not invoked with
  a byte string, enabling it to remove files that are non-ascii,
  even on Python 2.

* 712: In &#39;sandbox.run_setup&#39;, ensure that ``__file__`` is
  always a ``str``, modeling the behavior observed by the
  interpreter when invoking scripts and modules.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 891: In &#39;test&#39; command on test failure, raise DistutilsError,
  suppression invocation of subsequent commands.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 890: Revert 849. ``global-exclude .foo`` will not match all
  ``*.foo`` files any more. Package authors must add an explicit
  wildcard, such as ``global-exclude *.foo``, to match all
  ``.foo`` files. See 886, 849.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 885: Fix regression where &#39;pkg_resources._rebuild_mod_path&#39;
  would fail when a namespace package&#39;s &#39;__path__&#39; was not
  a list with a sort attribute.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 250: Install &#39;-nspkg.pth&#39; files for packages installed
  with &#39;setup.py develop&#39;. These .pth files allow
  namespace packages installed by pip or develop to
  co-mingle. This change required the removal of the
  change for 805 and pip 1924, introduced in 28.3.0 and implicated
  in 870, but means that namespace packages not in a
  site packages directory will no longer work on Python
  earlier than 3.5, whereas before they would work on
  Python not earlier than 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 879: For declarative config:

  - read_configuration() now accepts ignore_option_errors argument. This allows scraping tools to read metadata without a need to download entire packages. E.g. we can gather some stats right from GitHub repos just by downloading setup.cfg.

  - packages find: directive now supports fine tuning from a subsection. The same arguments as for find() are accepted.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 394 via 862: Added support for `declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file
  &lt;https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.htmlconfiguring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files&gt;`_.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.1
   ```
   -------

* 850: In test command, invoke unittest.main with
  indication not to exit the process.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 854: Bump to vendored Packaging 16.8.

   -------------------

You can view the `3.2.1 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Fix subtle bug when deciding whether to report an on-by-default&#39;s violation
  (See also `GitLab257`_)

- Fix another bug around SyntaxErrors not being reported at the right column
  and row (See also `GitLab259`_ and `GitLab237`_ for a related, previously
  fixed bug)

- Fix regression from 2.x where we run checks against explicitly provided
  files, even if they don&#39;t match the filename patterns. (See also
  `GitLab266`_)

   ### 3.1.1
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.1 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Do not attempt to install/distribute a ``man`` file with the Python package;
  leave this for others to do. (See also `GitLab254`_)

- Fix packaging bug where wheel version constraints specified in setup.cfg did
  not match the constraints in setup.py. (See also `GitLab255`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.1.0
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.0 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Add ``--bug-report`` flag to make issue reporters&#39; lives easier.

- Collect configuration files from the current directory when using our Git
  hook. (See also `GitLab210`_, `GitLab218`_, `GitLab223`_)

- Avoid unhandled exceptions when dealing with SyntaxErrors. (See also
  `GitLab214`_, `GitLab238`_)

- Exit early if the value for ``--diff`` is empty. (See also `GitLab226`_)

- Handle empty ``--stdin-display-name`` values. (See also `GitLab235`_)

- Properly report the column number of Syntax Errors. We were assuming that
  all reports of column numbers were 0-indexed, however, SyntaxErrors report
  the column number as 1-indexed. This caused us to report a column number
  that was 1 past the actual position. Further, when combined with
  SyntaxErrors that occur at a newline, this caused the position to be
  visually off by two. (See also `GitLab237`_)

- Fix the behaviour of ``--enable-extensions``. Previously, items specified
  here were still ignored due to the fact that the off-by-default extension
  codes were being left in the ``ignore`` list. (See also `GitLab239`_)

- Fix problems around ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` behaviour that prevented
  codes that were neither explicitly selected nor explicitly ignored from
  being reported. (See also `GitLab242`_)

- Truly be quiet when the user specifies ``-q`` one or more times. Previously,
  we were showing the if the user specified ``-q`` and ``--show-source``. We
  have fixed this bug. (See also `GitLab245`_)

- Add new File Processor attribute, ``previous_unindented_logical_line`` to
  accommodate pycodestyle 2.1.0. (See also `GitLab246`_)

- When something goes wrong, exit non-zero. (See also `GitLab248`_,
  `GitLab209`_)

- Add ``--tee`` as an option to allow use of ``--output-file`` and printing to
  standard out.

- Allow the git plugin to actually be lazy when collecting files.

- Allow for pycodestyle 2.1 series and pyflakes 1.3 series.

   ### 3.0.4
   ```
   -------------------

- Side-step a Pickling Error when using Flake8 with multiprocessing on Unix
  systems. (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix an Attribute Error raised when dealing with Invalid Syntax. (See also
  `GitLab203`_)

- Fix an unhandled Syntax Error when tokenizing files. (See also
  `GitLab205`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.3
   ```
   -------------------

- Disable ``--jobs`` for any version of Python on Windows.
  (See also `this Python bug report`_)

- Raise exception when entry_point in plugin not callable.
  This raises an informative error when a plugin fails to load because its
  entry_point is not callable, which can happen with a plugin which is buggy or
  not updated for the current version of flake8. This is nicer than raising a
  `PicklingError` about failing to pickle a module (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix `` noqa`` comments followed by a ``:`` and explanation broken by
  3.0.0 (See also `GitLab178`_)

- Always open our output file in append mode so we do not overwrite log
  messages. (See also `GitLab193`_)

- When normalizing path values read from configuration, keep in context the
  directory where the configuration was found so that relative paths work.
  (See also `GitLab194`_)

- Fix issue where users were unable to ignore plugin errors that were on
  by default. (See also `GitLab195`_)

- Fix our legacy API StyleGuide&#39;s ``init_report`` method to actually override
  the previous formatter. (See also `GitLab200`_)

   ### 3.0.2
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix local config file discovery.  (See also `GitLab181`_)

- Fix indexing of column numbers. We accidentally were starting column indices
  at 0 instead of 1.

- Fix regression in handling of errors like E402 that rely on a combination of
  attributes. (See also `GitLab186`_)

   ### 3.0.1
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix regression in handling of `` noqa`` for multiline strings.
  (See also `GitLab177`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--output-file`` when not also using
  ``--verbose``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--quiet``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--statistics``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   -------------------

- Rewrite our documentation from scratch! (http://flake8.pycqa.org)

- Drop explicit support for Pythons 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3.

- Remove dependence on pep8/pycodestyle for file processing, plugin
  dispatching, and more. We now control all of this while keeping backwards
  compatibility.

- ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` can now both be specified and try to find the
  most specific rule from each. For example, if you do ``--select E --ignore
  E123`` then we will report everything that starts with ``E`` except for
  ``E123``. Previously, you would have had to do ``--ignore E123,F,W`` which
  will also still work, but the former should be far more intuitive.

- Add support for in-line `` noqa`` comments to specify **only** the error
  codes to be ignored, e.g., `` noqa: E123,W503``

- Add entry-point for formatters as well as a base class that new formatters
  can inherit from. See the documentation for more details.

- Add detailed verbose output using the standard library logging module.

- Enhance our usage of optparse for plugin developers by adding new parameters
  to the ``add_option`` that plugins use to register new options.

- Update ``--install-hook`` to require the name of version control system hook
  you wish to install a Flake8.

- Stop checking sub-directories more than once via the setuptools command

- When passing a file on standard-in, allow the caller to specify
  ``--stdin-display-name`` so the output is properly formatted

- The Git hook now uses ``sys.executable`` to format the shebang line.
  This allows Flake8 to install a hook script from a virtualenv that points to
  that virtualenv&#39;s Flake8 as opposed to a global one (without the virtualenv
  being sourced).

- Print results in a deterministic and consistent ordering when used with
  multiprocessing

- When using ``--count``, the output is no longer written to stderr.

- AST plugins can either be functions or classes and all plugins can now
  register options so long as there are callable attributes named as we
  expect.

- Stop forcibly re-adding ``.tox``, ``.eggs``, and ``*.eggs`` to
  ``--exclude``. Flake8 2.x started always appending those three patterns
  to any exclude list (including the default and any user supplied list).
  Flake8 3 has stopped adding these in, so you may see errors when upgrading
  due to these patterns no longer being forcibly excluded by default if you
  have your own exclude patterns specified.

  To fix this, add the appropriate patterns to your exclude patterns list.

   ### 2.6.1
   ```
   ------------------

  exclusive options to flake8. (`GitLab8`_, `GitLab!18`_)

- **Feature** Allow git hook configuration to live in ``.git/config``.
  See the updated `VCS hooks docs`_ for more details. (`GitLab!20`_)

  Multiprocessing is forcibly disabled in the following cases:

  - Passing something in via stdin

  - Analyzing a diff

  - Using windows

- Fix --install-hook when there are no config files present for pep8 or
  flake8.

- Fix how the setuptools command parses excludes in config files

  (invalid on all platforms, but code was only executed on Windows) (Issue 91)
- Added the PyPA Code of Conduct (Pull Request 56)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.26.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix multiple entrypoint comparison failure on Python 3 (Issue 148)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.25.0
   ```
   ======
- Add Python 3.5 to tox configuration
- Deterministic (sorted) metadata
- Fix tagging for Python 3.5 compatibility
- Support py2-none-&#39;arch&#39; and py3-none-&#39;arch&#39; tags
- Treat data-only wheels as pure
- Write to temporary file and rename when using wheel install --force
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.24.0
   ```
   ======
- The python tag used for pure-python packages is now .pyN (major version
  only). This change actually occurred in 0.23.0 when the --python-tag
  option was added, but was not explicitly mentioned in the changelog then.
- wininst2wheel and egg2wheel removed. Use &quot;wheel convert [archive]&quot;
  instead.
- Wheel now supports setuptools style conditional requirements via the
  extras_require={} syntax. Separate &#39;extra&#39; names from conditions using
  the : character. Wheel&#39;s own setup.py does this. (The empty-string
  extra is the same as install_requires.) These conditional requirements
  should work the same whether the package is installed by wheel or
  by setup.py.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.23.0
   ```
   ======
- Compatibility tag flags added to the bdist_wheel command
- sdist should include files necessary for tests
- &#39;wheel convert&#39; can now also convert unpacked eggs to wheel
- Rename pydist.json to metadata.json to avoid stepping on the PEP
- The --skip-scripts option has been removed, and not generating scripts is now
  the default. The option was a temporary approach until installers could
  generate scripts themselves. That is now the case with pip 1.5 and later.
  Note that using pip 1.4 to install a wheel without scripts will leave the
  installation without entry-point wrappers. The &quot;wheel install-scripts&quot;
  command can be used to generate the scripts in such cases.
- Thank you contributors
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.22.0
   ```
   ======
- Include entry_points.txt, scripts a.k.a. commands, in experimental
  pydist.json
- Improved test_requires parsing
- Python 2.6 fixes, &quot;wheel version&quot; command courtesy pombredanne
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.21.0
   ```
   ======
- Pregenerated scripts are the default again.
- &quot;setup.py bdist_wheel --skip-scripts&quot; turns them off.
- setuptools is no longer a listed requirement for the &#39;wheel&#39;
  package. It is of course still required in order for bdist_wheel
  to work.
- &quot;python -m wheel&quot; avoids importing pkg_resources until it&#39;s necessary.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.20.0
   ```
   ======
- No longer include console_scripts in wheels. Ordinary scripts (shell files,
  standalone Python files) are included as usual.
- Include new command &quot;python -m wheel install-scripts [distribution
  [distribution ...]]&quot; to install the console_scripts (setuptools-style
  scripts using pkg_resources) for a distribution.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.19.0
   ```
   ======
- pymeta.json becomes pydist.json

- Put the description in the newly allowed payload section of PKG-INFO
  (METADATA) files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.13.0

   ```
   ======
- Preserve attributes on install.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.10.0
   ```
   ======
- Include a copy of pkg_resources. Wheel can now install into a virtualenv
  that does not have distribute (though most packages still require
  pkg_resources to actually work; wheel install distribute)
- Define a new setup.cfg section [wheel]. universal=1 will
  apply the py2.py3-none-any tag for pure python wheels.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.7
   ```
   =====
- Only import dirspec when needed. dirspec is only needed to find the
  configuration for keygen/signing operations.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.6
   ```
   =====
- requires-dist from setup.cfg overwrites any requirements from setup.py
  Care must be taken that the requirements are the same in both cases,
  or just always install from wheel.

- improved command line utility, adds &#39;wheel convert [egg or wininst]&#39; to
  convert legacy binary formats to wheel
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.5
   ```
   =====
- Wheel&#39;s own wheel file can be executed by Python, and can install itself:
  ``python wheel-0.9.5-py27-none-any/wheel install ...``
- Use argparse; basic ``wheel install`` command should run with only stdlib
  dependencies.
- Allow requires_dist in setup.cfg&#39;s [metadata] section. In addition to
  dependencies in setup.py, but will only be interpreted when installing
  from wheel, not from sdist. Can be qualified with environment markers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.4
   ```
   =====
- Fix wheel.signatures in sdist
   ```

- Integrated &quot;wheel install&quot; command (single package, no dependency
  resolution) including compatibility check.
- Support Python 3.3

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.2
   ```
   =====
- Automatic signing if WHEEL_TOOL points to the wheel binary
- Even more Python 3 fixes
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.1
   ```
   =====
- &#39;wheel sign&#39; uses the keys generated by &#39;wheel keygen&#39; (instead of generating
  a new key at random each time)
- Python 2/3 encoding/decoding fixes
- Run tests on Python 2.6 (without signature verification)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9

* 1081: Environment markers indicated in ``install_requires``
  are now processed and treated as nameless ``extras_require``
  with markers, allowing their metadata in requires.txt to be
  correctly generated.

* 1053: Tagged commits are now released using Travis-CI
  build stages, meaning releases depend on passing tests on
  all supported Python versions (Linux) and not just the latest
  Python version.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Correct ``py31compat.makedirs`` to correctly honor
  ``exist_ok`` parameter.
* 1083: Also use makedirs compatibility throughout setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Avoid race condition on directory creation in
  ``pkg_resources.ensure_directory``.

* Removed deprecation of and restored support for
  ``upload_docs`` command for sites other than PyPI.
  Only warehouse is dropping support, but services like
  `devpi &lt;http://doc.devpi.net/latest/&gt;`_ continue to
  support docs built by setuptools&#39; plugins. See
  `this comment &lt;https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/devpi/issues/388/support-rtd-model-for-building-uploadingcomment-34292423&gt;`_
  for more context on the motivation for this change.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 1042: Fix import in py27compat module that still
  referenced six directly, rather than through the externs
  module (vendored packages hook).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 980 and others: Once again, Setuptools vendors all
  of its dependencies. It seems to be the case that in
  the Python ecosystem, all build tools must run without
  any dependencies (build, runtime, or otherwise). At
  such a point that a mechanism exists that allows
  build tools to have dependencies, Setuptools will adopt
  it.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 1015: Fix test failures on Python 3.7.

* 1024: Add workaround for Jython 2581 in monkey module.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 992: Revert change introduced in v34.4.1, now
  considered invalid.

* 1016: Revert change introduced in v35.0.0 per 1014,
  referencing 436. The approach had unintended
  consequences, causing sdist installs to be missing
  files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 436: In egg_info.manifest_maker, no longer read
  the file list from the manifest file, and instead
  re-build it on each build. In this way, files removed
  from the specification will not linger in the manifest.
  As a result, any files manually added to the manifest
  will be removed on subsequent egg_info invocations.
  No projects should be manually adding files to the
  manifest and should instead use MANIFEST.in or SCM
  file finders to force inclusion of files in the manifest.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.1
   ```
   -------

* 1008: In MSVC support, use always the last version available for Windows SDK and UCRT SDK.

* 1008: In MSVC support, fix &quot;vcruntime140.dll&quot; returned path with Visual Studio 2017.

* 992: In msvc.msvc9_query_vcvarsall, ensure the
  returned dicts have str values and not Unicode for
  compatibility with os.environ.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 995: In MSVC support, add support for &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio 2017&quot; and &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools 2017&quot;.

* 999 via 1007: Extend support for declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file to include the options
  ``python_requires`` and ``py_modules``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.3
   ```
   -------

* 967 (and 997): Explicitly import submodules of
  packaging to account for environments where the imports
  of those submodules is not implied by other behavior.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.2
   ```
   -------

* 993: Fix documentation upload by correcting
  rendering of content-type in _build_multipart
  on Python 3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 988: Trap ``os.unlink`` same as ``os.remove`` in
  ``auto_chmod`` error handler.

* 983: Fixes to invalid escape sequence deprecations on
  Python 3.6.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 941: In the upload command, if the username is blank,
  default to ``getpass.getuser()``.

* 971: Correct distutils findall monkeypatch to match
  appropriate versions (namely Python 3.4.6).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 966: Add support for reading dist-info metadata and
  thus locating Distributions from zip files.

* 968: Allow &#39;+&#39; and &#39;!&#39; in egg fragments
  so that it can take package names that contain
  PEP 440 conforming version specifiers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 953: More aggressively employ the compatibility issue
  originally added in 706.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 930: ``build_info`` now accepts two new parameters
  to optimize and customize the building of C libraries.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.3
   ```
   -------

* 947: Loosen restriction on the version of six required,
  restoring compatibility with environments relying on
  six 1.6.0 and later.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 882: Ensure extras are honored when building the
  working set.
* 913: Fix issue in develop if package directory has
  a trailing slash.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 935: Fix glob syntax in graft.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 581: Instead of vendoring the growing list of
  dependencies that Setuptools requires to function,
  Setuptools now requires these dependencies just like
  any other project. Unlike other projects, however,
  Setuptools cannot rely on ``setup_requires`` to
  demand the dependencies it needs to install because
  its own machinery would be necessary to pull those
  dependencies if not present (a bootstrapping problem).
  As a result, Setuptools no longer supports self upgrade or
  installation in the general case. Instead, users are
  directed to use pip to install and upgrade using the
  ``wheel`` distributions of setuptools.

  Users are welcome to contrive other means to install
  or upgrade Setuptools using other means, such as
  pre-installing the Setuptools dependencies with pip
  or a bespoke bootstrap tool, but such usage is not
  recommended and is not supported.

  As discovered in 940, not all versions of pip will
  successfully install Setuptools from its pre-built
  wheel. If you encounter issues with &quot;No module named
  six&quot; or &quot;No module named packaging&quot;, especially
  following a line &quot;Running setup.py egg_info for package
  setuptools&quot;, then your pip is not new enough.

  There&#39;s an additional issue in pip where setuptools
  is upgraded concurrently with other source packages,
  described in pip 4253. The proposed workaround is to
  always upgrade Setuptools first prior to upgrading
  other packages that would upgrade Setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 921: Correct issue where certifi fallback not being
  reached on Windows.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.0
   ```
   -------

Installation via pip, as indicated in the `Python Packaging
User&#39;s Guide &lt;https://packaging.python.org/installing/&gt;`_,
is the officially-supported mechanism for installing
Setuptools, and this recommendation is now explicit in the
much more concise README.

Other edits and tweaks were made to the documentation. The
codebase is unchanged.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 619: Removed support for the ``tag_svn_revision``
  distribution option. If Subversion tagging support is
  still desired, consider adding the functionality to
  setuptools_svn in setuptools_svn 2.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 866: Use ``dis.Bytecode`` on Python 3.4 and later in
  ``setuptools.depends``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 889: Backport proposed fix for disabling interpolation in
  distutils.Distribution.parse_config_files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 884: Restore support for running the tests under
  `pytest-runner &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner&gt;`_
  by ensuring that PYTHONPATH is honored in tests invoking
  a subprocess.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.3
   ```
   -------

* 706: Add rmtree compatibility shim for environments where
  rmtree fails when passed a unicode string.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.2
   ```
   -------

* 893: Only release sdist in zip format as warehouse now
  disallows releasing two different formats.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 704: More selectively ensure that &#39;rmtree&#39; is not invoked with
  a byte string, enabling it to remove files that are non-ascii,
  even on Python 2.

* 712: In &#39;sandbox.run_setup&#39;, ensure that ``__file__`` is
  always a ``str``, modeling the behavior observed by the
  interpreter when invoking scripts and modules.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 891: In &#39;test&#39; command on test failure, raise DistutilsError,
  suppression invocation of subsequent commands.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 890: Revert 849. ``global-exclude .foo`` will not match all
  ``*.foo`` files any more. Package authors must add an explicit
  wildcard, such as ``global-exclude *.foo``, to match all
  ``.foo`` files. See 886, 849.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 885: Fix regression where &#39;pkg_resources._rebuild_mod_path&#39;
  would fail when a namespace package&#39;s &#39;__path__&#39; was not
  a list with a sort attribute.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 250: Install &#39;-nspkg.pth&#39; files for packages installed
  with &#39;setup.py develop&#39;. These .pth files allow
  namespace packages installed by pip or develop to
  co-mingle. This change required the removal of the
  change for 805 and pip 1924, introduced in 28.3.0 and implicated
  in 870, but means that namespace packages not in a
  site packages directory will no longer work on Python
  earlier than 3.5, whereas before they would work on
  Python not earlier than 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 879: For declarative config:

  - read_configuration() now accepts ignore_option_errors argument. This allows scraping tools to read metadata without a need to download entire packages. E.g. we can gather some stats right from GitHub repos just by downloading setup.cfg.

  - packages find: directive now supports fine tuning from a subsection. The same arguments as for find() are accepted.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 394 via 862: Added support for `declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file
  &lt;https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.htmlconfiguring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files&gt;`_.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.1
   ```
   -------

* 850: In test command, invoke unittest.main with
  indication not to exit the process.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 854: Bump to vendored Packaging 16.8.

   ### 3.1.1
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.1 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Do not attempt to install/distribute a ``man`` file with the Python package;
  leave this for others to do. (See also `GitLab254`_)

- Fix packaging bug where wheel version constraints specified in setup.cfg did
  not match the constraints in setup.py. (See also `GitLab255`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.1.0
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.0 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Add ``--bug-report`` flag to make issue reporters&#39; lives easier.

- Collect configuration files from the current directory when using our Git
  hook. (See also `GitLab210`_, `GitLab218`_, `GitLab223`_)

- Avoid unhandled exceptions when dealing with SyntaxErrors. (See also
  `GitLab214`_, `GitLab238`_)

- Exit early if the value for ``--diff`` is empty. (See also `GitLab226`_)

- Handle empty ``--stdin-display-name`` values. (See also `GitLab235`_)

- Properly report the column number of Syntax Errors. We were assuming that
  all reports of column numbers were 0-indexed, however, SyntaxErrors report
  the column number as 1-indexed. This caused us to report a column number
  that was 1 past the actual position. Further, when combined with
  SyntaxErrors that occur at a newline, this caused the position to be
  visually off by two. (See also `GitLab237`_)

- Fix the behaviour of ``--enable-extensions``. Previously, items specified
  here were still ignored due to the fact that the off-by-default extension
  codes were being left in the ``ignore`` list. (See also `GitLab239`_)

- Fix problems around ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` behaviour that prevented
  codes that were neither explicitly selected nor explicitly ignored from
  being reported. (See also `GitLab242`_)

- Truly be quiet when the user specifies ``-q`` one or more times. Previously,
  we were showing the if the user specified ``-q`` and ``--show-source``. We
  have fixed this bug. (See also `GitLab245`_)

- Add new File Processor attribute, ``previous_unindented_logical_line`` to
  accommodate pycodestyle 2.1.0. (See also `GitLab246`_)

- When something goes wrong, exit non-zero. (See also `GitLab248`_,
  `GitLab209`_)

- Add ``--tee`` as an option to allow use of ``--output-file`` and printing to
  standard out.

- Allow the git plugin to actually be lazy when collecting files.

- Allow for pycodestyle 2.1 series and pyflakes 1.3 series.

   ### 3.0.4
   ```
   -------------------

- Side-step a Pickling Error when using Flake8 with multiprocessing on Unix
  systems. (See also `GitLab164`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.3
   ```
   -------------------

- Disable ``--jobs`` for any version of Python on Windows.
  (See also `this Python bug report`_)

- Raise exception when entry_point in plugin not callable.
  This raises an informative error when a plugin fails to load because its
  entry_point is not callable, which can happen with a plugin which is buggy or
  not updated for the current version of flake8. This is nicer than raising a
  `PicklingError` about failing to pickle a module (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix `` noqa`` comments followed by a ``:`` and explanation broken by
  3.0.0 (See also `GitLab178`_)

- Always open our output file in append mode so we do not overwrite log
  messages. (See also `GitLab193`_)

- When normalizing path values read from configuration, keep in context the
  directory where the configuration was found so that relative paths work.
  (See also `GitLab194`_)

- Fix issue where users were unable to ignore plugin errors that were on
  by default. (See also `GitLab195`_)

- Fix our legacy API StyleGuide&#39;s ``init_report`` method to actually override
  the previous formatter. (See also `GitLab200`_)

   ### 3.0.2
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix local config file discovery.  (See also `GitLab181`_)

- Fix indexing of column numbers. We accidentally were starting column indices
  at 0 instead of 1.

- Fix regression in handling of errors like E402 that rely on a combination of
  attributes. (See also `GitLab186`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.1
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix regression in handling of `` noqa`` for multiline strings.
  (See also `GitLab177`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--output-file`` when not also using
  ``--verbose``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--quiet``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--statistics``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

.. _GitLab180:
    https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/180
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   -------------------

- Rewrite our documentation from scratch! (http://flake8.pycqa.org)

- Drop explicit support for Pythons 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3.

- Remove dependence on pep8/pycodestyle for file processing, plugin
  dispatching, and more. We now control all of this while keeping backwards
  compatibility.

- ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` can now both be specified and try to find the
  most specific rule from each. For example, if you do ``--select E --ignore
  E123`` then we will report everything that starts with ``E`` except for
  ``E123``. Previously, you would have had to do ``--ignore E123,F,W`` which
  will also still work, but the former should be far more intuitive.

- Add support for in-line `` noqa`` comments to specify **only** the error
  codes to be ignored, e.g., `` noqa: E123,W503``

- Add entry-point for formatters as well as a base class that new formatters
  can inherit from. See the documentation for more details.

- Add detailed verbose output using the standard library logging module.

- Enhance our usage of optparse for plugin developers by adding new parameters
  to the ``add_option`` that plugins use to register new options.

- Update ``--install-hook`` to require the name of version control system hook
  you wish to install a Flake8.

- Stop checking sub-directories more than once via the setuptools command

- When passing a file on standard-in, allow the caller to specify
  ``--stdin-display-name`` so the output is properly formatted

- The Git hook now uses ``sys.executable`` to format the shebang line.
  This allows Flake8 to install a hook script from a virtualenv that points to
  that virtualenv&#39;s Flake8 as opposed to a global one (without the virtualenv
  being sourced).

- Print results in a deterministic and consistent ordering when used with
  multiprocessing

- When using ``--count``, the output is no longer written to stderr.

- AST plugins can either be functions or classes and all plugins can now
  register options so long as there are callable attributes named as we
  expect.

- Stop forcibly re-adding ``.tox``, ``.eggs``, and ``*.eggs`` to
  ``--exclude``. Flake8 2.x started always appending those three patterns
  to any exclude list (including the default and any user supplied list).
  Flake8 3 has stopped adding these in, so you may see errors when upgrading
  due to these patterns no longer being forcibly excluded by default if you
  have your own exclude patterns specified.

  To fix this, add the appropriate patterns to your exclude patterns list.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.4.0
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Print filenames when using multiprocessing and ``-q`` option.

  exclusive options to flake8. (`GitLab8`_, `GitLab!18`_)

- **Feature** Allow git hook configuration to live in ``.git/config``.
  See the updated `VCS hooks docs`_ for more details. (`GitLab!20`_)

  Multiprocessing is forcibly disabled in the following cases:

  - Passing something in via stdin

  - Analyzing a diff

  - Using windows

- Fix --install-hook when there are no config files present for pep8 or
  flake8.

- Fix how the setuptools command parses excludes in config files

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.30.0
   ```
   ======
- Added py-limited-api {cp32|cp33|cp34|...} flag to produce cpNN.abi3.{arch}
  tags on CPython 3.
- Documented the ``license_file`` metadata key
- Improved Python, abi tagging for `wheel convert`. Thanks Ales Erjavec.
- Fixed `&gt;` being prepended to lines starting with &quot;From&quot; in the long description
- Added support for specifying a build number (as per PEP 427).
  Thanks Ian Cordasco.

- Made the order of requirements in metadata deterministic. Thanks Chris Lamb.
- Fixed `wheel install` clobbering existing files
- Improved the error message when trying to verify an unsigned wheel file
- Removed support for Python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.29.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix compression type of files in archive (Issue 155, Pull Request 62,
  thanks Xavier Fernandez)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.28.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix file modes in archive (Issue 154)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.27.0
   ```
   ======
- Support forcing a platform tag using `--plat-name` on pure-Python wheels, as
  well as nonstandard platform tags on non-pure wheels (Pull Request 60, Issue
  144, thanks AndrÃ©s DÃ­az)
- Add SOABI tags to platform-specific wheels built for Python 2.X (Pull Request
  55, Issue 63, Issue 101)
- Support reproducible wheel files, wheels that can be rebuilt and will hash to
  the same values as previous builds (Pull Request 52, Issue 143, thanks
  Barry Warsaw)
- Support for changes in keyring &gt;= 8.0 (Pull Request 61, thanks Jason R.
  Coombs)
- Use the file context manager when checking if dependency_links.txt is empty,
  fixes problems building wheels under PyPy on Windows  (Issue 150, thanks
  Cosimo Lupo)
- Don&#39;t attempt to (recursively) create a build directory ending with `..`
  (invalid on all platforms, but code was only executed on Windows) (Issue 91)
- Added the PyPA Code of Conduct (Pull Request 56)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.26.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix multiple entrypoint comparison failure on Python 3 (Issue 148)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.25.0
   ```
   ======
- Add Python 3.5 to tox configuration
- Deterministic (sorted) metadata
- Fix tagging for Python 3.5 compatibility
- Support py2-none-&#39;arch&#39; and py3-none-&#39;arch&#39; tags
- Treat data-only wheels as pure
- Write to temporary file and rename when using wheel install --force
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.24.0
   ```
   ======
- The python tag used for pure-python packages is now .pyN (major version
  only). This change actually occurred in 0.23.0 when the --python-tag
  option was added, but was not explicitly mentioned in the changelog then.
- wininst2wheel and egg2wheel removed. Use &quot;wheel convert [archive]&quot;
  instead.
- Wheel now supports setuptools style conditional requirements via the
  extras_require={} syntax. Separate &#39;extra&#39; names from conditions using
  the : character. Wheel&#39;s own setup.py does this. (The empty-string
  extra is the same as install_requires.) These conditional requirements
  should work the same whether the package is installed by wheel or
  by setup.py.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.23.0
   ```
   ======
- Compatibility tag flags added to the bdist_wheel command
- sdist should include files necessary for tests
- &#39;wheel convert&#39; can now also convert unpacked eggs to wheel
- Rename pydist.json to metadata.json to avoid stepping on the PEP
- The --skip-scripts option has been removed, and not generating scripts is now
  the default. The option was a temporary approach until installers could
  generate scripts themselves. That is now the case with pip 1.5 and later.
  Note that using pip 1.4 to install a wheel without scripts will leave the
  installation without entry-point wrappers. The &quot;wheel install-scripts&quot;
  command can be used to generate the scripts in such cases.
- Thank you contributors
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.22.0
   ```
   ======
- Include entry_points.txt, scripts a.k.a. commands, in experimental
  pydist.json
- Improved test_requires parsing
- Python 2.6 fixes, &quot;wheel version&quot; command courtesy pombredanne
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.21.0
   ```
   ======
- Pregenerated scripts are the default again.
- &quot;setup.py bdist_wheel --skip-scripts&quot; turns them off.
- setuptools is no longer a listed requirement for the &#39;wheel&#39;
  package. It is of course still required in order for bdist_wheel
  to work.
- &quot;python -m wheel&quot; avoids importing pkg_resources until it&#39;s necessary.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.20.0
   ```
   ======
- No longer include console_scripts in wheels. Ordinary scripts (shell files,
  standalone Python files) are included as usual.
- Include new command &quot;python -m wheel install-scripts [distribution
  [distribution ...]]&quot; to install the console_scripts (setuptools-style
  scripts using pkg_resources) for a distribution.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.19.0
   ```
   ======
- pymeta.json becomes pydist.json
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.18.0
   ```
   ======
- Python 3 Unicode improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.17.0
   ```
   ======
- Support latest PEP-426 &quot;pymeta.json&quot; (json-format metadata)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.16.0
   ```
   ======
- Python 2.6 compatibility bugfix (thanks John McFarlane)
- Non-prerelease version number
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.15.0
   ```
   ======
- Various improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.14.0
   ```
   ======
- Changed the signature format to better comply with the current JWS spec.
  Breaks all existing signatures.
- Include ``wheel unsign`` command to remove RECORD.jws from an archive.
- Put the description in the newly allowed payload section of PKG-INFO
  (METADATA) files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.13.0
   ```
   ======
- Use distutils instead of sysconfig to get installation paths; can install
  headers.
- Improve WheelFile() sort.
- Allow bootstrap installs without any pkg_resources.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.12.0
   ```
   ======

   ```
   ======
- Preserve attributes on install.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.10.0
   ```
   ======
- Include a copy of pkg_resources. Wheel can now install into a virtualenv
  that does not have distribute (though most packages still require
  pkg_resources to actually work; wheel install distribute)
- Define a new setup.cfg section [wheel]. universal=1 will
  apply the py2.py3-none-any tag for pure python wheels.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.7
   ```
   =====
- Only import dirspec when needed. dirspec is only needed to find the
  configuration for keygen/signing operations.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.6
   ```
   =====
- requires-dist from setup.cfg overwrites any requirements from setup.py
  Care must be taken that the requirements are the same in both cases,
  or just always install from wheel.
- drop dirspec requirement on win32
- improved command line utility, adds &#39;wheel convert [egg or wininst]&#39; to
  convert legacy binary formats to wheel
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.5
   ```
   =====
- Wheel&#39;s own wheel file can be executed by Python, and can install itself:
  ``python wheel-0.9.5-py27-none-any/wheel install ...``
- Use argparse; basic ``wheel install`` command should run with only stdlib
  dependencies.
- Allow requires_dist in setup.cfg&#39;s [metadata] section. In addition to
  dependencies in setup.py, but will only be interpreted when installing
  from wheel, not from sdist. Can be qualified with environment markers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.4
   ```
   =====
- Fix wheel.signatures in sdist
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.3
   ```
   =====
- Integrated digital signatures support without C extensions.
- Integrated &quot;wheel install&quot; command (single package, no dependency
  resolution) including compatibility check.
- Support Python 3.3
- Use Metadata 1.3 (PEP 426)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.2
   ```
   =====
- Automatic signing if WHEEL_TOOL points to the wheel binary
- Even more Python 3 fixes
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.1
   ```
   =====
- &#39;wheel sign&#39; uses the keys generated by &#39;wheel keygen&#39; (instead of generating
  a new key at random each time)
- Python 2/3 encoding/decoding fixes
- Run tests on Python 2.6 (without signature verification)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9
   ```
   ===
- Updated digital signatures scheme
- Python 3 support for digital signatures
- Always verify RECORD hashes on extract
- &quot;wheel&quot; command line tool to sign, verify, unpack wheel files
   ```

   ```
   ===
- none/any draft pep tags update
- improved wininst2wheel script
- doc changes and other improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.7
   ```

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.6.1
   ```
   -------

* 1132: Removed redundant and costly serialization/parsing step
  in ``EntryPoint.__init__``.

* 844: ``bdist_egg --exclude-source-files`` now tested and works
  on Python 3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.6.0
   ```
   -------

* 1143: Added ``setuptools.build_meta`` module, an implementation
  of PEP-517 for Setuptools-defined packages.

* 1143: Added ``dist_info`` command for producing dist_info
  metadata.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.5.0
   ```
   -------

* 170: When working with Mercurial checkouts, use Windows-friendly
  syntax for suppressing output.

* Inspired by 1134, performed substantial refactoring of
  ``pkg_resources.find_on_path`` to facilitate an optimization
  for paths with many non-version entries.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 1075: Add new ``Description-Content-Type`` metadata field. `See here for
  documentation on how to use this field.
  &lt;https://packaging.python.org/specifications/description-content-type&gt;`_

* 1068: Sort files and directories when building eggs for
  deterministic order.

* 196: Remove caching of easy_install command in fetch_build_egg.
  Fixes issue where ``pytest-runner-N.N`` would satisfy the installation
  of ``pytest``.

* 1129: Fix working set dependencies handling when replacing conflicting
  distributions (e.g. when using ``setup_requires`` with a conflicting
  transitive dependency, fix 1124).

* 1133: Improved handling of README files extensions and added
  Markdown to the list of searched READMES.

* 1135: Improve performance of pkg_resources import by not invoking
  ``access`` or ``stat`` and using ``os.listdir`` instead.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 1131: Make possible using several files within ``file:`` directive
  in metadata.long_description in ``setup.cfg``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.7
   ```
   -------

* fix 1105: Fix handling of requirements with environment
  markers when declared in ``setup.cfg`` (same treatment as
  for 1081).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.6
   ```
   -------

* 462: Don&#39;t assume a directory is an egg by the ``.egg``
  extension alone.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.5
   ```
   -------

* 1093: Fix test command handler with extras_require.
* 1112, 1091, 1115: Now using Trusty containers in
  Travis for CI and CD.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.4
   ```
   -------

* 1092: ``pkg_resources`` now uses ``inspect.getmro`` to
  resolve classes in method resolution order.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.3
   ```
   -------

* 1102: Restore behavior for empty extras.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.2
   ```
   -------

* 1099: Revert commit a3ec721, restoring intended purpose of
  extras as part of a requirement declaration.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.1
   ```
   -------

* fix 1086
* fix 1087
* support extras specifiers in install_requires requirements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 1081: Environment markers indicated in ``install_requires``
  are now processed and treated as nameless ``extras_require``
  with markers, allowing their metadata in requires.txt to be
  correctly generated.

* 1053: Tagged commits are now released using Travis-CI
  build stages, meaning releases depend on passing tests on
  all supported Python versions (Linux) and not just the latest
  Python version.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Correct ``py31compat.makedirs`` to correctly honor
  ``exist_ok`` parameter.
* 1083: Also use makedirs compatibility throughout setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Avoid race condition on directory creation in
  ``pkg_resources.ensure_directory``.

* Removed deprecation of and restored support for
  ``upload_docs`` command for sites other than PyPI.
  Only warehouse is dropping support, but services like
  `devpi &lt;http://doc.devpi.net/latest/&gt;`_ continue to
  support docs built by setuptools&#39; plugins. See
  `this comment &lt;https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/devpi/issues/388/support-rtd-model-for-building-uploadingcomment-34292423&gt;`_
  for more context on the motivation for this change.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 1042: Fix import in py27compat module that still
  referenced six directly, rather than through the externs
  module (vendored packages hook).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 980 and others: Once again, Setuptools vendors all
  of its dependencies. It seems to be the case that in
  the Python ecosystem, all build tools must run without
  any dependencies (build, runtime, or otherwise). At
  such a point that a mechanism exists that allows
  build tools to have dependencies, Setuptools will adopt
  it.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 1015: Fix test failures on Python 3.7.

* 1024: Add workaround for Jython 2581 in monkey module.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 992: Revert change introduced in v34.4.1, now
  considered invalid.

* 1016: Revert change introduced in v35.0.0 per 1014,
  referencing 436. The approach had unintended
  consequences, causing sdist installs to be missing
  files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 436: In egg_info.manifest_maker, no longer read
  the file list from the manifest file, and instead
  re-build it on each build. In this way, files removed
  from the specification will not linger in the manifest.
  As a result, any files manually added to the manifest
  will be removed on subsequent egg_info invocations.
  No projects should be manually adding files to the
  manifest and should instead use MANIFEST.in or SCM
  file finders to force inclusion of files in the manifest.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.1
   ```
   -------

* 1008: In MSVC support, use always the last version available for Windows SDK and UCRT SDK.

* 1008: In MSVC support, fix &quot;vcruntime140.dll&quot; returned path with Visual Studio 2017.

* 992: In msvc.msvc9_query_vcvarsall, ensure the
  returned dicts have str values and not Unicode for
  compatibility with os.environ.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 995: In MSVC support, add support for &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio 2017&quot; and &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools 2017&quot;.

* 999 via 1007: Extend support for declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file to include the options
  ``python_requires`` and ``py_modules``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.3
   ```
   -------

* 967 (and 997): Explicitly import submodules of
  packaging to account for environments where the imports
  of those submodules is not implied by other behavior.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.2
   ```
   -------

* 993: Fix documentation upload by correcting
  rendering of content-type in _build_multipart
  on Python 3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 988: Trap ``os.unlink`` same as ``os.remove`` in
  ``auto_chmod`` error handler.

* 983: Fixes to invalid escape sequence deprecations on
  Python 3.6.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 941: In the upload command, if the username is blank,
  default to ``getpass.getuser()``.

* 971: Correct distutils findall monkeypatch to match
  appropriate versions (namely Python 3.4.6).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 966: Add support for reading dist-info metadata and
  thus locating Distributions from zip files.

* 968: Allow &#39;+&#39; and &#39;!&#39; in egg fragments
  so that it can take package names that contain
  PEP 440 conforming version specifiers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 953: More aggressively employ the compatibility issue
  originally added in 706.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 930: ``build_info`` now accepts two new parameters
  to optimize and customize the building of C libraries.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.3
   ```
   -------

* 947: Loosen restriction on the version of six required,
  restoring compatibility with environments relying on
  six 1.6.0 and later.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 882: Ensure extras are honored when building the
  working set.
* 913: Fix issue in develop if package directory has
  a trailing slash.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 935: Fix glob syntax in graft.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 581: Instead of vendoring the growing list of
  dependencies that Setuptools requires to function,
  Setuptools now requires these dependencies just like
  any other project. Unlike other projects, however,
  Setuptools cannot rely on ``setup_requires`` to
  demand the dependencies it needs to install because
  its own machinery would be necessary to pull those
  dependencies if not present (a bootstrapping problem).
  As a result, Setuptools no longer supports self upgrade or
  installation in the general case. Instead, users are
  directed to use pip to install and upgrade using the
  ``wheel`` distributions of setuptools.

  Users are welcome to contrive other means to install
  or upgrade Setuptools using other means, such as
  pre-installing the Setuptools dependencies with pip
  or a bespoke bootstrap tool, but such usage is not
  recommended and is not supported.

  As discovered in 940, not all versions of pip will
  successfully install Setuptools from its pre-built
  wheel. If you encounter issues with &quot;No module named
  six&quot; or &quot;No module named packaging&quot;, especially
  following a line &quot;Running setup.py egg_info for package
  setuptools&quot;, then your pip is not new enough.

  There&#39;s an additional issue in pip where setuptools
  is upgraded concurrently with other source packages,
  described in pip 4253. The proposed workaround is to
  always upgrade Setuptools first prior to upgrading
  other packages that would upgrade Setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 921: Correct issue where certifi fallback not being
  reached on Windows.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.0
   ```
   -------

Installation via pip, as indicated in the `Python Packaging
User&#39;s Guide &lt;https://packaging.python.org/installing/&gt;`_,
is the officially-supported mechanism for installing
Setuptools, and this recommendation is now explicit in the
much more concise README.

Other edits and tweaks were made to the documentation. The
codebase is unchanged.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 619: Removed support for the ``tag_svn_revision``
  distribution option. If Subversion tagging support is
  still desired, consider adding the functionality to
  setuptools_svn in setuptools_svn 2.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 866: Use ``dis.Bytecode`` on Python 3.4 and later in
  ``setuptools.depends``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 889: Backport proposed fix for disabling interpolation in
  distutils.Distribution.parse_config_files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 884: Restore support for running the tests under
  `pytest-runner &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner&gt;`_
  by ensuring that PYTHONPATH is honored in tests invoking
  a subprocess.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.3
   ```
   -------

* 706: Add rmtree compatibility shim for environments where
  rmtree fails when passed a unicode string.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.2
   ```
   -------

* 893: Only release sdist in zip format as warehouse now
  disallows releasing two different formats.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 704: More selectively ensure that &#39;rmtree&#39; is not invoked with
  a byte string, enabling it to remove files that are non-ascii,
  even on Python 2.

* 712: In &#39;sandbox.run_setup&#39;, ensure that ``__file__`` is
  always a ``str``, modeling the behavior observed by the
  interpreter when invoking scripts and modules.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 891: In &#39;test&#39; command on test failure, raise DistutilsError,
  suppression invocation of subsequent commands.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 890: Revert 849. ``global-exclude .foo`` will not match all
  ``*.foo`` files any more. Package authors must add an explicit
  wildcard, such as ``global-exclude *.foo``, to match all
  ``.foo`` files. See 886, 849.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 885: Fix regression where &#39;pkg_resources._rebuild_mod_path&#39;
  would fail when a namespace package&#39;s &#39;__path__&#39; was not
  a list with a sort attribute.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 250: Install &#39;-nspkg.pth&#39; files for packages installed
  with &#39;setup.py develop&#39;. These .pth files allow
  namespace packages installed by pip or develop to
  co-mingle. This change required the removal of the
  change for 805 and pip 1924, introduced in 28.3.0 and implicated
  in 870, but means that namespace packages not in a
  site packages directory will no longer work on Python
  earlier than 3.5, whereas before they would work on
  Python not earlier than 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 879: For declarative config:

  - read_configuration() now accepts ignore_option_errors argument. This allows scraping tools to read metadata without a need to download entire packages. E.g. we can gather some stats right from GitHub repos just by downloading setup.cfg.

  - packages find: directive now supports fine tuning from a subsection. The same arguments as for find() are accepted.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 394 via 862: Added support for `declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file
  &lt;https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.htmlconfiguring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files&gt;`_.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.1
   ```
   -------

* 850: In test command, invoke unittest.main with
  indication not to exit the process.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 854: Bump to vendored Packaging 16.8.

   ### 3.1.0
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.0 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Add ``--bug-report`` flag to make issue reporters&#39; lives easier.

- Collect configuration files from the current directory when using our Git
  hook. (See also `GitLab210`_, `GitLab218`_, `GitLab223`_)

- Avoid unhandled exceptions when dealing with SyntaxErrors. (See also
  `GitLab214`_, `GitLab238`_)

- Exit early if the value for ``--diff`` is empty. (See also `GitLab226`_)

- Handle empty ``--stdin-display-name`` values. (See also `GitLab235`_)

- Properly report the column number of Syntax Errors. We were assuming that
  all reports of column numbers were 0-indexed, however, SyntaxErrors report
  the column number as 1-indexed. This caused us to report a column number
  that was 1 past the actual position. Further, when combined with
  SyntaxErrors that occur at a newline, this caused the position to be
  visually off by two. (See also `GitLab237`_)

- Fix the behaviour of ``--enable-extensions``. Previously, items specified
  here were still ignored due to the fact that the off-by-default extension
  codes were being left in the ``ignore`` list. (See also `GitLab239`_)

- Fix problems around ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` behaviour that prevented
  codes that were neither explicitly selected nor explicitly ignored from
  being reported. (See also `GitLab242`_)

- Truly be quiet when the user specifies ``-q`` one or more times. Previously,
  we were showing the if the user specified ``-q`` and ``--show-source``. We
  have fixed this bug. (See also `GitLab245`_)

- Add new File Processor attribute, ``previous_unindented_logical_line`` to
  accommodate pycodestyle 2.1.0. (See also `GitLab246`_)

- When something goes wrong, exit non-zero. (See also `GitLab248`_,
  `GitLab209`_)

- Add ``--tee`` as an option to allow use of ``--output-file`` and printing to
  standard out.

- Allow the git plugin to actually be lazy when collecting files.

- Allow for pycodestyle 2.1 series and pyflakes 1.3 series.

   ### 3.0.4
   ```
   -------------------

- Side-step a Pickling Error when using Flake8 with multiprocessing on Unix
  systems. (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix an Attribute Error raised when dealing with Invalid Syntax. (See also
  `GitLab203`_)

- Fix an unhandled Syntax Error when tokenizing files. (See also
  `GitLab205`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.3
   ```
   -------------------

- Disable ``--jobs`` for any version of Python on Windows.
  (See also `this Python bug report`_)

- Raise exception when entry_point in plugin not callable.
  This raises an informative error when a plugin fails to load because its
  entry_point is not callable, which can happen with a plugin which is buggy or
  not updated for the current version of flake8. This is nicer than raising a
  `PicklingError` about failing to pickle a module (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix `` noqa`` comments followed by a ``:`` and explanation broken by
  3.0.0 (See also `GitLab178`_)

- Always open our output file in append mode so we do not overwrite log
  messages. (See also `GitLab193`_)

- When normalizing path values read from configuration, keep in context the
  directory where the configuration was found so that relative paths work.
  (See also `GitLab194`_)

- Fix issue where users were unable to ignore plugin errors that were on
  by default. (See also `GitLab195`_)

- Fix our legacy API StyleGuide&#39;s ``init_report`` method to actually override
  the previous formatter. (See also `GitLab200`_)

   ### 3.0.2
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix local config file discovery.  (See also `GitLab181`_)

- Fix indexing of column numbers. We accidentally were starting column indices
  at 0 instead of 1.

- Fix regression in handling of errors like E402 that rely on a combination of
  attributes. (See also `GitLab186`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.1
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix regression in handling of `` noqa`` for multiline strings.
  (See also `GitLab177`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--output-file`` when not also using
  ``--verbose``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--quiet``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--statistics``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   -------------------

- Rewrite our documentation from scratch! (http://flake8.pycqa.org)

- Drop explicit support for Pythons 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3.

- Remove dependence on pep8/pycodestyle for file processing, plugin
  dispatching, and more. We now control all of this while keeping backwards
  compatibility.

- ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` can now both be specified and try to find the
  most specific rule from each. For example, if you do ``--select E --ignore
  E123`` then we will report everything that starts with ``E`` except for
  ``E123``. Previously, you would have had to do ``--ignore E123,F,W`` which
  will also still work, but the former should be far more intuitive.

- Add support for in-line `` noqa`` comments to specify **only** the error
  codes to be ignored, e.g., `` noqa: E123,W503``

- Add entry-point for formatters as well as a base class that new formatters
  can inherit from. See the documentation for more details.

- Add detailed verbose output using the standard library logging module.

- Enhance our usage of optparse for plugin developers by adding new parameters
  to the ``add_option`` that plugins use to register new options.

- Update ``--install-hook`` to require the name of version control system hook
  you wish to install a Flake8.

- Stop checking sub-directories more than once via the setuptools command

- When passing a file on standard-in, allow the caller to specify
  ``--stdin-display-name`` so the output is properly formatted

- The Git hook now uses ``sys.executable`` to format the shebang line.
  This allows Flake8 to install a hook script from a virtualenv that points to
  that virtualenv&#39;s Flake8 as opposed to a global one (without the virtualenv
  being sourced).

- Print results in a deterministic and consistent ordering when used with
  multiprocessing

- When using ``--count``, the output is no longer written to stderr.

- AST plugins can either be functions or classes and all plugins can now
  register options so long as there are callable attributes named as we
  expect.

- Stop forcibly re-adding ``.tox``, ``.eggs``, and ``*.eggs`` to
  ``--exclude``. Flake8 2.x started always appending those three patterns
  to any exclude list (including the default and any user supplied list).
  Flake8 3 has stopped adding these in, so you may see errors when upgrading
  due to these patterns no longer being forcibly excluded by default if you
  have your own exclude patterns specified.

  To fix this, add the appropriate patterns to your exclude patterns list.

  .. note::

      This item was added in November of 2016, as a result of a bug
      report.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.6.2

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.6.1
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Update the config files to search for to include ``setup.cfg`` and
  ``tox.ini``. This was broken in 2.5.5 when we stopped passing
  ``config_file`` to our Style Guide

   ### 2.6.0
   ```
   ------------------

- **Requirements Change** Switch to pycodestyle as all future pep8 releases
  will use that package name

   ------------------

- **Bug** Properly look for ``.flake8`` in current working directory
  (`GitLab103`_)

- **Bug** Monkey-patch ``pep8.stdin_get_value`` to cache the actual value in
  stdin. This helps plugins relying on the function when run with
  multiprocessing. (`GitLab105`_, `GitLab107`_)

.. _GitLab103: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/103

.. _GitLab!23: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/merge_requests/23
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.4.0
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Print filenames when using multiprocessing and ``-q`` option.

  was run from a git hook. (`GitHub2`_)

- **Improvement** Print warnings for users who are providing mutually
  exclusive options to flake8. (`GitLab8`_, `GitLab!18`_)

- **Feature** Allow git hook configuration to live in ``.git/config``.
  See the updated `VCS hooks docs`_ for more details. (`GitLab!20`_)

- Make the check for &quot; flake8: noqa&quot; more strict
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.2.4

   ------------------

- Fix bugs triggered by turning multiprocessing on by default (again)

  Multiprocessing is forcibly disabled in the following cases:

  - Passing something in via stdin

  - Analyzing a diff

  - Using windows

- Fix --install-hook when there are no config files present for pep8 or
  flake8.

- Fix how the setuptools command parses excludes in config files

- Fix how the git hook determines which files to analyze (Thanks Chris
  Buccella!)
   ```

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

- Pyflakes errors are prefixed by an ``F`` instead of an ``E``
- McCabe complexity warnings are prefixed by a ``C`` instead of a ``W``

   ```
   ----------------

- Now requires isort &gt;= 4.3.0.
  [jleclanche]
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.4
   ```
   ----------------

- Fix input handling with flake8&#39;s --stdin-display-name, and simplify it.
  [blueyed]

- Remove flake8-polyfill dependency.  flake8 &gt;= 3.2.1 is required already, and
  stdin is not read directly anymore.

   ```
   ----------------

- Fix typo.
  [paltman]

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.2.2
   ```
   ------------------

- Workaround for isort bug when skipping files.

- Fix yet another corner case.
  [gforcada]
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.1.2
   ```
   ------------------

  [cas--]
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.1.0
   ```
   ------------------

- Show the exact line and kind of error,

   ```
   ======

- Removed the (already defunct) ``tool`` extras from setup.py
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.30.0
   ```
   ======
- Added py-limited-api {cp32|cp33|cp34|...} flag to produce cpNN.abi3.{arch}
  tags on CPython 3.
- Documented the ``license_file`` metadata key
- Improved Python, abi tagging for `wheel convert`. Thanks Ales Erjavec.
- Fixed `&gt;` being prepended to lines starting with &quot;From&quot; in the long description
- Added support for specifying a build number (as per PEP 427).
  Thanks Ian Cordasco.
- Made the order of files in generated ZIP files deterministic.
  Thanks Matthias Bach.
- Made the order of requirements in metadata deterministic. Thanks Chris Lamb.
- Fixed `wheel install` clobbering existing files
- Improved the error message when trying to verify an unsigned wheel file
- Removed support for Python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.29.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix compression type of files in archive (Issue 155, Pull Request 62,
  thanks Xavier Fernandez)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.28.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix file modes in archive (Issue 154)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.27.0
   ```
   ======
- Support forcing a platform tag using `--plat-name` on pure-Python wheels, as
  well as nonstandard platform tags on non-pure wheels (Pull Request 60, Issue
  144, thanks AndrÃ©s DÃ­az)
- Add SOABI tags to platform-specific wheels built for Python 2.X (Pull Request
  55, Issue 63, Issue 101)
- Support reproducible wheel files, wheels that can be rebuilt and will hash to
  the same values as previous builds (Pull Request 52, Issue 143, thanks
  Barry Warsaw)
- Support for changes in keyring &gt;= 8.0 (Pull Request 61, thanks Jason R.
  Coombs)
- Use the file context manager when checking if dependency_links.txt is empty,
  fixes problems building wheels under PyPy on Windows  (Issue 150, thanks
  Cosimo Lupo)
- Don&#39;t attempt to (recursively) create a build directory ending with `..`
  (invalid on all platforms, but code was only executed on Windows) (Issue 91)
- Added the PyPA Code of Conduct (Pull Request 56)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.26.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix multiple entrypoint comparison failure on Python 3 (Issue 148)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.25.0
   ```
   ======
- Add Python 3.5 to tox configuration
- Deterministic (sorted) metadata
- Fix tagging for Python 3.5 compatibility
- Support py2-none-&#39;arch&#39; and py3-none-&#39;arch&#39; tags
- Treat data-only wheels as pure
- Write to temporary file and rename when using wheel install --force
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.24.0
   ```
   ======
- The python tag used for pure-python packages is now .pyN (major version
  only). This change actually occurred in 0.23.0 when the --python-tag
  option was added, but was not explicitly mentioned in the changelog then.
- wininst2wheel and egg2wheel removed. Use &quot;wheel convert [archive]&quot;
  instead.
- Wheel now supports setuptools style conditional requirements via the
  extras_require={} syntax. Separate &#39;extra&#39; names from conditions using
  the : character. Wheel&#39;s own setup.py does this. (The empty-string
  extra is the same as install_requires.) These conditional requirements
  should work the same whether the package is installed by wheel or
  by setup.py.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.23.0
   ```
   ======
- Compatibility tag flags added to the bdist_wheel command
- sdist should include files necessary for tests
- &#39;wheel convert&#39; can now also convert unpacked eggs to wheel
- Rename pydist.json to metadata.json to avoid stepping on the PEP
- The --skip-scripts option has been removed, and not generating scripts is now
  the default. The option was a temporary approach until installers could
  generate scripts themselves. That is now the case with pip 1.5 and later.
  Note that using pip 1.4 to install a wheel without scripts will leave the
  installation without entry-point wrappers. The &quot;wheel install-scripts&quot;
  command can be used to generate the scripts in such cases.
- Thank you contributors
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.22.0
   ```
   ======
- Include entry_points.txt, scripts a.k.a. commands, in experimental
  pydist.json
- Improved test_requires parsing
- Python 2.6 fixes, &quot;wheel version&quot; command courtesy pombredanne
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.21.0
   ```
   ======
- Pregenerated scripts are the default again.
- &quot;setup.py bdist_wheel --skip-scripts&quot; turns them off.
- setuptools is no longer a listed requirement for the &#39;wheel&#39;
  package. It is of course still required in order for bdist_wheel
  to work.
- &quot;python -m wheel&quot; avoids importing pkg_resources until it&#39;s necessary.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.20.0
   ```
   ======
- No longer include console_scripts in wheels. Ordinary scripts (shell files,
  standalone Python files) are included as usual.
- Include new command &quot;python -m wheel install-scripts [distribution
  [distribution ...]]&quot; to install the console_scripts (setuptools-style
  scripts using pkg_resources) for a distribution.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.19.0
   ```
   ======
- pymeta.json becomes pydist.json
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.18.0
   ```
   ======
- Python 3 Unicode improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.17.0
   ```
   ======
- Support latest PEP-426 &quot;pymeta.json&quot; (json-format metadata)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.16.0
   ```
   ======
- Python 2.6 compatibility bugfix (thanks John McFarlane)
- Non-prerelease version number
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.15.0
   ```
   ======
- Various improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.14.0
   ```
   ======
- Changed the signature format to better comply with the current JWS spec.
  Breaks all existing signatures.
- Include ``wheel unsign`` command to remove RECORD.jws from an archive.
- Put the description in the newly allowed payload section of PKG-INFO
  (METADATA) files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.13.0
   ```
   ======
- Use distutils instead of sysconfig to get installation paths; can install
  headers.
- Improve WheelFile() sort.
- Allow bootstrap installs without any pkg_resources.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.12.0
   ```
   ======
- Unit test for wheel.tool.install
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.11.0
   ```
   ======
- API cleanup
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.10.3
   ```
   ======

   ```
   ======
- Preserve attributes on install.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.10.0
   ```
   ======
- Include a copy of pkg_resources. Wheel can now install into a virtualenv
  that does not have distribute (though most packages still require
  pkg_resources to actually work; wheel install distribute)
- Define a new setup.cfg section [wheel]. universal=1 will
  apply the py2.py3-none-any tag for pure python wheels.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.7
   ```
   =====
- Only import dirspec when needed. dirspec is only needed to find the
  configuration for keygen/signing operations.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.6
   ```
   =====
- requires-dist from setup.cfg overwrites any requirements from setup.py
  Care must be taken that the requirements are the same in both cases,
  or just always install from wheel.
- drop dirspec requirement on win32
- improved command line utility, adds &#39;wheel convert [egg or wininst]&#39; to
  convert legacy binary formats to wheel
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.5
   ```
   =====
- Wheel&#39;s own wheel file can be executed by Python, and can install itself:
  ``python wheel-0.9.5-py27-none-any/wheel install ...``
- Use argparse; basic ``wheel install`` command should run with only stdlib
  dependencies.
- Allow requires_dist in setup.cfg&#39;s [metadata] section. In addition to
  dependencies in setup.py, but will only be interpreted when installing
  from wheel, not from sdist. Can be qualified with environment markers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.4
   ```
   =====
- Fix wheel.signatures in sdist
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.3
   ```
   =====
- Integrated digital signatures support without C extensions.
- Integrated &quot;wheel install&quot; command (single package, no dependency
  resolution) including compatibility check.
- Support Python 3.3
- Use Metadata 1.3 (PEP 426)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.2
   ```
   =====
- Automatic signing if WHEEL_TOOL points to the wheel binary
- Even more Python 3 fixes
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.1
   ```
   =====
- &#39;wheel sign&#39; uses the keys generated by &#39;wheel keygen&#39; (instead of generating
  a new key at random each time)
- Python 2/3 encoding/decoding fixes
- Run tests on Python 2.6 (without signature verification)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9
   ```
   ===
- Updated digital signatures scheme
- Python 3 support for digital signatures
- Always verify RECORD hashes on extract
- &quot;wheel&quot; command line tool to sign, verify, unpack wheel files
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.8
   ```
   ===
- none/any draft pep tags update
- improved wininst2wheel script
- doc changes and other improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.7
   ```
   ===

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.4.0
   ```
   -------

  transitive dependency, fix 1124).

* 1133: Improved handling of README files extensions and added
  Markdown to the list of searched READMES.

* 1135: Improve performance of pkg_resources import by not invoking
  ``access`` or ``stat`` and using ``os.listdir`` instead.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 1131: Make possible using several files within ``file:`` directive
  in metadata.long_description in ``setup.cfg``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.7
   ```
   -------

* fix 1105: Fix handling of requirements with environment
  markers when declared in ``setup.cfg`` (same treatment as
  for 1081).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.6
   ```
   -------

* 462: Don&#39;t assume a directory is an egg by the ``.egg``

   ### 36.2.2
   ```
   -------

   ### 36.2.1
   ```
   -------

* fix 1086
* fix 1087
* support extras specifiers in install_requires requirements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 1081: Environment markers indicated in ``install_requires``
  are now processed and treated as nameless ``extras_require``
  with markers, allowing their metadata in requires.txt to be
  correctly generated.

* 1053: Tagged commits are now released using Travis-CI
  build stages, meaning releases depend on passing tests on
  all supported Python versions (Linux) and not just the latest
  Python version.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Correct ``py31compat.makedirs`` to correctly honor
  ``exist_ok`` parameter.
* 1083: Also use makedirs compatibility throughout setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Avoid race condition on directory creation in
  ``pkg_resources.ensure_directory``.

* Removed deprecation of and restored support for
  ``upload_docs`` command for sites other than PyPI.
  Only warehouse is dropping support, but services like
  `devpi &lt;http://doc.devpi.net/latest/&gt;`_ continue to
  support docs built by setuptools&#39; plugins. See
  `this comment &lt;https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/devpi/issues/388/support-rtd-model-for-building-uploadingcomment-34292423&gt;`_
  for more context on the motivation for this change.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 1042: Fix import in py27compat module that still
  referenced six directly, rather than through the externs
  module (vendored packages hook).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 980 and others: Once again, Setuptools vendors all
  of its dependencies. It seems to be the case that in
  the Python ecosystem, all build tools must run without
  any dependencies (build, runtime, or otherwise). At
  such a point that a mechanism exists that allows
  build tools to have dependencies, Setuptools will adopt
  it.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 1015: Fix test failures on Python 3.7.

* 1024: Add workaround for Jython 2581 in monkey module.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 992: Revert change introduced in v34.4.1, now
  considered invalid.

* 1016: Revert change introduced in v35.0.0 per 1014,
  referencing 436. The approach had unintended
  consequences, causing sdist installs to be missing
  files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 436: In egg_info.manifest_maker, no longer read
  the file list from the manifest file, and instead
  re-build it on each build. In this way, files removed
  from the specification will not linger in the manifest.
  As a result, any files manually added to the manifest
  will be removed on subsequent egg_info invocations.
  No projects should be manually adding files to the
  manifest and should instead use MANIFEST.in or SCM
  file finders to force inclusion of files in the manifest.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.1
   ```
   -------

* 1008: In MSVC support, use always the last version available for Windows SDK and UCRT SDK.

* 1008: In MSVC support, fix &quot;vcruntime140.dll&quot; returned path with Visual Studio 2017.

* 992: In msvc.msvc9_query_vcvarsall, ensure the
  returned dicts have str values and not Unicode for
  compatibility with os.environ.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 995: In MSVC support, add support for &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio 2017&quot; and &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools 2017&quot;.

* 999 via 1007: Extend support for declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file to include the options
  ``python_requires`` and ``py_modules``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.3
   ```
   -------

* 967 (and 997): Explicitly import submodules of
  packaging to account for environments where the imports
  of those submodules is not implied by other behavior.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.2
   ```
   -------

* 993: Fix documentation upload by correcting
  rendering of content-type in _build_multipart
  on Python 3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 988: Trap ``os.unlink`` same as ``os.remove`` in
  ``auto_chmod`` error handler.

* 983: Fixes to invalid escape sequence deprecations on
  Python 3.6.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 941: In the upload command, if the username is blank,
  default to ``getpass.getuser()``.

* 971: Correct distutils findall monkeypatch to match
  appropriate versions (namely Python 3.4.6).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 966: Add support for reading dist-info metadata and
  thus locating Distributions from zip files.

* 968: Allow &#39;+&#39; and &#39;!&#39; in egg fragments
  so that it can take package names that contain
  PEP 440 conforming version specifiers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 953: More aggressively employ the compatibility issue
  originally added in 706.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 930: ``build_info`` now accepts two new parameters
  to optimize and customize the building of C libraries.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.3
   ```
   -------

* 947: Loosen restriction on the version of six required,
  restoring compatibility with environments relying on
  six 1.6.0 and later.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 882: Ensure extras are honored when building the
  working set.
* 913: Fix issue in develop if package directory has
  a trailing slash.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 935: Fix glob syntax in graft.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 581: Instead of vendoring the growing list of
  dependencies that Setuptools requires to function,
  Setuptools now requires these dependencies just like
  any other project. Unlike other projects, however,
  Setuptools cannot rely on ``setup_requires`` to
  demand the dependencies it needs to install because
  its own machinery would be necessary to pull those
  dependencies if not present (a bootstrapping problem).
  As a result, Setuptools no longer supports self upgrade or
  installation in the general case. Instead, users are
  directed to use pip to install and upgrade using the
  ``wheel`` distributions of setuptools.

  Users are welcome to contrive other means to install
  or upgrade Setuptools using other means, such as
  pre-installing the Setuptools dependencies with pip
  or a bespoke bootstrap tool, but such usage is not
  recommended and is not supported.

  As discovered in 940, not all versions of pip will
  successfully install Setuptools from its pre-built
  wheel. If you encounter issues with &quot;No module named
  six&quot; or &quot;No module named packaging&quot;, especially
  following a line &quot;Running setup.py egg_info for package
  setuptools&quot;, then your pip is not new enough.

  There&#39;s an additional issue in pip where setuptools
  is upgraded concurrently with other source packages,
  described in pip 4253. The proposed workaround is to
  always upgrade Setuptools first prior to upgrading
  other packages that would upgrade Setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 921: Correct issue where certifi fallback not being
  reached on Windows.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.0
   ```
   -------

Installation via pip, as indicated in the `Python Packaging
User&#39;s Guide &lt;https://packaging.python.org/installing/&gt;`_,
is the officially-supported mechanism for installing
Setuptools, and this recommendation is now explicit in the
much more concise README.

Other edits and tweaks were made to the documentation. The
codebase is unchanged.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 619: Removed support for the ``tag_svn_revision``
  distribution option. If Subversion tagging support is
  still desired, consider adding the functionality to
  setuptools_svn in setuptools_svn 2.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 866: Use ``dis.Bytecode`` on Python 3.4 and later in
  ``setuptools.depends``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 889: Backport proposed fix for disabling interpolation in
  distutils.Distribution.parse_config_files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 884: Restore support for running the tests under
  `pytest-runner &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner&gt;`_
  by ensuring that PYTHONPATH is honored in tests invoking
  a subprocess.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.3
   ```
   -------

* 706: Add rmtree compatibility shim for environments where
  rmtree fails when passed a unicode string.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.2
   ```
   -------

* 893: Only release sdist in zip format as warehouse now
  disallows releasing two different formats.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 704: More selectively ensure that &#39;rmtree&#39; is not invoked with
  a byte string, enabling it to remove files that are non-ascii,
  even on Python 2.

* 712: In &#39;sandbox.run_setup&#39;, ensure that ``__file__`` is
  always a ``str``, modeling the behavior observed by the
  interpreter when invoking scripts and modules.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 891: In &#39;test&#39; command on test failure, raise DistutilsError,
  suppression invocation of subsequent commands.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 890: Revert 849. ``global-exclude .foo`` will not match all
  ``*.foo`` files any more. Package authors must add an explicit
  wildcard, such as ``global-exclude *.foo``, to match all
  ``.foo`` files. See 886, 849.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 885: Fix regression where &#39;pkg_resources._rebuild_mod_path&#39;
  would fail when a namespace package&#39;s &#39;__path__&#39; was not
  a list with a sort attribute.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 250: Install &#39;-nspkg.pth&#39; files for packages installed
  with &#39;setup.py develop&#39;. These .pth files allow
  namespace packages installed by pip or develop to
  co-mingle. This change required the removal of the
  change for 805 and pip 1924, introduced in 28.3.0 and implicated
  in 870, but means that namespace packages not in a
  site packages directory will no longer work on Python
  earlier than 3.5, whereas before they would work on
  Python not earlier than 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 879: For declarative config:

  - read_configuration() now accepts ignore_option_errors argument. This allows scraping tools to read metadata without a need to download entire packages. E.g. we can gather some stats right from GitHub repos just by downloading setup.cfg.

  - packages find: directive now supports fine tuning from a subsection. The same arguments as for find() are accepted.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 394 via 862: Added support for `declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file
  &lt;https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.htmlconfiguring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files&gt;`_.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.1
   ```
   -------

* 850: In test command, invoke unittest.main with
  indication not to exit the process.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 854: Bump to vendored Packaging 16.8.

  and row (See also `GitLab259`_ and `GitLab237`_ for a related, previously
  fixed bug)

- Fix regression from 2.x where we run checks against explicitly provided
  files, even if they don&#39;t match the filename patterns. (See also

   ### 3.1.1
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.1 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Do not attempt to install/distribute a ``man`` file with the Python package;
  leave this for others to do. (See also `GitLab254`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.1.0
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.0 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Add ``--bug-report`` flag to make issue reporters&#39; lives easier.

- Collect configuration files from the current directory when using our Git
  hook. (See also `GitLab210`_, `GitLab218`_, `GitLab223`_)

- Avoid unhandled exceptions when dealing with SyntaxErrors. (See also
  `GitLab214`_, `GitLab238`_)

- Exit early if the value for ``--diff`` is empty. (See also `GitLab226`_)

- Handle empty ``--stdin-display-name`` values. (See also `GitLab235`_)

- Properly report the column number of Syntax Errors. We were assuming that
  all reports of column numbers were 0-indexed, however, SyntaxErrors report
  the column number as 1-indexed. This caused us to report a column number
  that was 1 past the actual position. Further, when combined with
  SyntaxErrors that occur at a newline, this caused the position to be
  visually off by two. (See also `GitLab237`_)

- Fix the behaviour of ``--enable-extensions``. Previously, items specified
  here were still ignored due to the fact that the off-by-default extension
  codes were being left in the ``ignore`` list. (See also `GitLab239`_)

- Fix problems around ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` behaviour that prevented
  codes that were neither explicitly selected nor explicitly ignored from
  being reported. (See also `GitLab242`_)

- Truly be quiet when the user specifies ``-q`` one or more times. Previously,
  we were showing the if the user specified ``-q`` and ``--show-source``. We
  have fixed this bug. (See also `GitLab245`_)

- Add new File Processor attribute, ``previous_unindented_logical_line`` to
  accommodate pycodestyle 2.1.0. (See also `GitLab246`_)

- When something goes wrong, exit non-zero. (See also `GitLab248`_,
  `GitLab209`_)

- Add ``--tee`` as an option to allow use of ``--output-file`` and printing to
  standard out.

- Allow the git plugin to actually be lazy when collecting files.

- Allow for pycodestyle 2.1 series and pyflakes 1.3 series.

   ### 3.0.4
   ```
   -------------------

- Side-step a Pickling Error when using Flake8 with multiprocessing on Unix
  systems. (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix an Attribute Error raised when dealing with Invalid Syntax. (See also
  `GitLab203`_)

- Fix an unhandled Syntax Error when tokenizing files. (See also
  `GitLab205`_)

   ### 3.0.3
   ```
   -------------------

- Disable ``--jobs`` for any version of Python on Windows.
  (See also `this Python bug report`_)

- Raise exception when entry_point in plugin not callable.
  This raises an informative error when a plugin fails to load because its
  entry_point is not callable, which can happen with a plugin which is buggy or
  not updated for the current version of flake8. This is nicer than raising a
  `PicklingError` about failing to pickle a module (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix `` noqa`` comments followed by a ``:`` and explanation broken by
  3.0.0 (See also `GitLab178`_)

- Always open our output file in append mode so we do not overwrite log
  messages. (See also `GitLab193`_)

- When normalizing path values read from configuration, keep in context the
  directory where the configuration was found so that relative paths work.
  (See also `GitLab194`_)

- Fix issue where users were unable to ignore plugin errors that were on
  by default. (See also `GitLab195`_)

- Fix our legacy API StyleGuide&#39;s ``init_report`` method to actually override
  the previous formatter. (See also `GitLab200`_)

   ### 3.0.2
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix local config file discovery.  (See also `GitLab181`_)

- Fix indexing of column numbers. We accidentally were starting column indices
  at 0 instead of 1.

- Fix regression in handling of errors like E402 that rely on a combination of
  attributes. (See also `GitLab186`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.1
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix regression in handling of `` noqa`` for multiline strings.
  (See also `GitLab177`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--output-file`` when not also using
  ``--verbose``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--quiet``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--statistics``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

    https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/177
.. _GitLab180:
    https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/180
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   -------------------

- Rewrite our documentation from scratch! (http://flake8.pycqa.org)

- Drop explicit support for Pythons 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3.

- Remove dependence on pep8/pycodestyle for file processing, plugin
  dispatching, and more. We now control all of this while keeping backwards
  compatibility.

- ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` can now both be specified and try to find the
  most specific rule from each. For example, if you do ``--select E --ignore
  E123`` then we will report everything that starts with ``E`` except for
  ``E123``. Previously, you would have had to do ``--ignore E123,F,W`` which
  will also still work, but the former should be far more intuitive.

- Add support for in-line `` noqa`` comments to specify **only** the error
  codes to be ignored, e.g., `` noqa: E123,W503``

- Add entry-point for formatters as well as a base class that new formatters
  can inherit from. See the documentation for more details.

- Add detailed verbose output using the standard library logging module.

- Enhance our usage of optparse for plugin developers by adding new parameters
  to the ``add_option`` that plugins use to register new options.

- Update ``--install-hook`` to require the name of version control system hook
  you wish to install a Flake8.

- Stop checking sub-directories more than once via the setuptools command

- When passing a file on standard-in, allow the caller to specify
  ``--stdin-display-name`` so the output is properly formatted

- The Git hook now uses ``sys.executable`` to format the shebang line.
  This allows Flake8 to install a hook script from a virtualenv that points to
  that virtualenv&#39;s Flake8 as opposed to a global one (without the virtualenv
  being sourced).

- Print results in a deterministic and consistent ordering when used with
  multiprocessing

- When using ``--count``, the output is no longer written to stderr.

- AST plugins can either be functions or classes and all plugins can now
  register options so long as there are callable attributes named as we
  expect.

- Stop forcibly re-adding ``.tox``, ``.eggs``, and ``*.eggs`` to
  ``--exclude``. Flake8 2.x started always appending those three patterns
  to any exclude list (including the default and any user supplied list).
  Flake8 3 has stopped adding these in, so you may see errors when upgrading
  due to these patterns no longer being forcibly excluded by default if you
  have your own exclude patterns specified.

  To fix this, add the appropriate patterns to your exclude patterns list.

   ### 2.6.1
   ```
   ------------------

   ### 2.4.0
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Print filenames when using multiprocessing and ``-q`` option.

  exclusive options to flake8. (`GitLab8`_, `GitLab!18`_)

- **Feature** Allow git hook configuration to live in ``.git/config``.
  See the updated `VCS hooks docs`_ for more details. (`GitLab!20`_)

   ------------------

- Fix bugs triggered by turning multiprocessing on by default (again)

  Multiprocessing is forcibly disabled in the following cases:

  - Passing something in via stdin

  - Analyzing a diff

  - Using windows

- Fix --install-hook when there are no config files present for pep8 or
  flake8.

- Fix how the setuptools command parses excludes in config files

- Fix how the git hook determines which files to analyze (Thanks Chris
  Buccella!)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.2.3
   ```
   ------------------

- Flake8 now reports the column number for PyFlakes messages
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

- Pyflakes errors are prefixed by an ``F`` instead of an ``E``
- McCabe complexity warnings are prefixed by a ``C`` instead of a ``W``
- Flake8 supports extensions through entry points

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.31.0
   ```
   ======

- Removed the (already defunct) ``tool`` extras from setup.py
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.30.0
   ```
   ======
- Added py-limited-api {cp32|cp33|cp34|...} flag to produce cpNN.abi3.{arch}
  tags on CPython 3.
- Documented the ``license_file`` metadata key
- Improved Python, abi tagging for `wheel convert`. Thanks Ales Erjavec.
- Fixed `&gt;` being prepended to lines starting with &quot;From&quot; in the long description
- Added support for specifying a build number (as per PEP 427).
  Thanks Ian Cordasco.
- Made the order of files in generated ZIP files deterministic.
  Thanks Matthias Bach.
- Made the order of requirements in metadata deterministic. Thanks Chris Lamb.
- Fixed `wheel install` clobbering existing files
- Improved the error message when trying to verify an unsigned wheel file
- Removed support for Python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.29.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix compression type of files in archive (Issue 155, Pull Request 62,
  thanks Xavier Fernandez)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.28.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix file modes in archive (Issue 154)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.27.0
   ```
   ======
- Support forcing a platform tag using `--plat-name` on pure-Python wheels, as
  well as nonstandard platform tags on non-pure wheels (Pull Request 60, Issue
  144, thanks AndrÃ©s DÃ­az)
- Add SOABI tags to platform-specific wheels built for Python 2.X (Pull Request
  55, Issue 63, Issue 101)
- Support reproducible wheel files, wheels that can be rebuilt and will hash to
  the same values as previous builds (Pull Request 52, Issue 143, thanks
  Barry Warsaw)
- Support for changes in keyring &gt;= 8.0 (Pull Request 61, thanks Jason R.
  Coombs)
- Use the file context manager when checking if dependency_links.txt is empty,
  fixes problems building wheels under PyPy on Windows  (Issue 150, thanks
  Cosimo Lupo)
- Don&#39;t attempt to (recursively) create a build directory ending with `..`
  (invalid on all platforms, but code was only executed on Windows) (Issue 91)
- Added the PyPA Code of Conduct (Pull Request 56)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.26.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix multiple entrypoint comparison failure on Python 3 (Issue 148)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.25.0
   ```
   ======
- Add Python 3.5 to tox configuration
- Deterministic (sorted) metadata
- Fix tagging for Python 3.5 compatibility
- Support py2-none-&#39;arch&#39; and py3-none-&#39;arch&#39; tags
- Treat data-only wheels as pure
- Write to temporary file and rename when using wheel install --force
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.24.0
   ```
   ======
- The python tag used for pure-python packages is now .pyN (major version
  only). This change actually occurred in 0.23.0 when the --python-tag
  option was added, but was not explicitly mentioned in the changelog then.
- wininst2wheel and egg2wheel removed. Use &quot;wheel convert [archive]&quot;
  instead.
- Wheel now supports setuptools style conditional requirements via the
  extras_require={} syntax. Separate &#39;extra&#39; names from conditions using
  the : character. Wheel&#39;s own setup.py does this. (The empty-string
  extra is the same as install_requires.) These conditional requirements
  should work the same whether the package is installed by wheel or
  by setup.py.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.23.0
   ```
   ======
- Compatibility tag flags added to the bdist_wheel command
- sdist should include files necessary for tests
- &#39;wheel convert&#39; can now also convert unpacked eggs to wheel
- Rename pydist.json to metadata.json to avoid stepping on the PEP
- The --skip-scripts option has been removed, and not generating scripts is now
  the default. The option was a temporary approach until installers could
  generate scripts themselves. That is now the case with pip 1.5 and later.
  Note that using pip 1.4 to install a wheel without scripts will leave the
  installation without entry-point wrappers. The &quot;wheel install-scripts&quot;
  command can be used to generate the scripts in such cases.
- Thank you contributors
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.22.0
   ```
   ======
- Include entry_points.txt, scripts a.k.a. commands, in experimental
  pydist.json
- Improved test_requires parsing
- Python 2.6 fixes, &quot;wheel version&quot; command courtesy pombredanne
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.21.0
   ```
   ======
- Pregenerated scripts are the default again.
- &quot;setup.py bdist_wheel --skip-scripts&quot; turns them off.
- setuptools is no longer a listed requirement for the &#39;wheel&#39;
  package. It is of course still required in order for bdist_wheel
  to work.
- &quot;python -m wheel&quot; avoids importing pkg_resources until it&#39;s necessary.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.20.0
   ```
   ======
- No longer include console_scripts in wheels. Ordinary scripts (shell files,
  standalone Python files) are included as usual.
- Include new command &quot;python -m wheel install-scripts [distribution
  [distribution ...]]&quot; to install the console_scripts (setuptools-style
  scripts using pkg_resources) for a distribution.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.19.0
   ```
   ======
- pymeta.json becomes pydist.json
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.18.0
   ```
   ======
- Python 3 Unicode improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.17.0
   ```
   ======
- Support latest PEP-426 &quot;pymeta.json&quot; (json-format metadata)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.16.0
   ```
   ======
- Python 2.6 compatibility bugfix (thanks John McFarlane)
- Non-prerelease version number
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.15.0
   ```
   ======
- Various improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.14.0
   ```
   ======
- Changed the signature format to better comply with the current JWS spec.
  Breaks all existing signatures.
- Include ``wheel unsign`` command to remove RECORD.jws from an archive.
- Put the description in the newly allowed payload section of PKG-INFO
  (METADATA) files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.13.0
   ```
   ======
- Use distutils instead of sysconfig to get installation paths; can install
  headers.
- Improve WheelFile() sort.
- Allow bootstrap installs without any pkg_resources.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.12.0
   ```
   ======

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.11.0

   ```
   ======
- Preserve attributes on install.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.10.0
   ```
   ======
- Include a copy of pkg_resources. Wheel can now install into a virtualenv
  that does not have distribute (though most packages still require
  pkg_resources to actually work; wheel install distribute)
- Define a new setup.cfg section [wheel]. universal=1 will
  apply the py2.py3-none-any tag for pure python wheels.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.7
   ```
   =====
- Only import dirspec when needed. dirspec is only needed to find the
  configuration for keygen/signing operations.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.6
   ```
   =====
- requires-dist from setup.cfg overwrites any requirements from setup.py
  Care must be taken that the requirements are the same in both cases,
  or just always install from wheel.
- drop dirspec requirement on win32
- improved command line utility, adds &#39;wheel convert [egg or wininst]&#39; to
  convert legacy binary formats to wheel
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.5
   ```
   =====
- Wheel&#39;s own wheel file can be executed by Python, and can install itself:
  ``python wheel-0.9.5-py27-none-any/wheel install ...``
- Use argparse; basic ``wheel install`` command should run with only stdlib
  dependencies.
- Allow requires_dist in setup.cfg&#39;s [metadata] section. In addition to
  dependencies in setup.py, but will only be interpreted when installing
  from wheel, not from sdist. Can be qualified with environment markers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.4
   ```
   =====
- Fix wheel.signatures in sdist
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.3
   ```
   =====
- Integrated digital signatures support without C extensions.
- Integrated &quot;wheel install&quot; command (single package, no dependency
  resolution) including compatibility check.
- Support Python 3.3
- Use Metadata 1.3 (PEP 426)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.2
   ```
   =====
- Automatic signing if WHEEL_TOOL points to the wheel binary
- Even more Python 3 fixes
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.1
   ```
   =====
- &#39;wheel sign&#39; uses the keys generated by &#39;wheel keygen&#39; (instead of generating
  a new key at random each time)
- Python 2/3 encoding/decoding fixes
- Run tests on Python 2.6 (without signature verification)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9
   ```
   ===
- Updated digital signatures scheme
- Python 3 support for digital signatures
- Always verify RECORD hashes on extract
- &quot;wheel&quot; command line tool to sign, verify, unpack wheel files
   ```

   ```
   ===
- none/any draft pep tags update
- improved wininst2wheel script
- doc changes and other improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.7
   ```

  unordered sequences (sets or dicts).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 37.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 878: Drop support for Python 2.6. Python 2.6 users should

  on Python 3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.6.0
   ```

  metadata.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.5.0

* Inspired by 1134, performed substantial refactoring of
  ``pkg_resources.find_on_path`` to facilitate an optimization
  for paths with many non-version entries.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.4.0
   ```
   -------

  &lt;https://packaging.python.org/specifications/description-content-type&gt;`_

* 1068: Sort files and directories when building eggs for
  deterministic order.

* 196: Remove caching of easy_install command in fetch_build_egg.
  Fixes issue where ``pytest-runner-N.N`` would satisfy the installation
  of ``pytest``.

* 1129: Fix working set dependencies handling when replacing conflicting

  transitive dependency, fix 1124).

* 1133: Improved handling of README files extensions and added
  Markdown to the list of searched READMES.

* 1135: Improve performance of pkg_resources import by not invoking
  ``access`` or ``stat`` and using ``os.listdir`` instead.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 1131: Make possible using several files within ``file:`` directive
  in metadata.long_description in ``setup.cfg``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.7
   ```
   -------

* fix 1105: Fix handling of requirements with environment
  markers when declared in ``setup.cfg`` (same treatment as
  for 1081).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.6
   ```
   -------

* 462: Don&#39;t assume a directory is an egg by the ``.egg``
  extension alone.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.5
   ```
   -------

* 1093: Fix test command handler with extras_require.

  Travis for CI and CD.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.4
   ```
   -------

* 1092: ``pkg_resources`` now uses ``inspect.getmro`` to
  resolve classes in method resolution order.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.3
   ```
   -------

* 1102: Restore behavior for empty extras.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.2
   ```
   -------

* 1099: Revert commit a3ec721, restoring intended purpose of

   ### 36.2.1
   ```
   -------

* fix 1086
* fix 1087
* support extras specifiers in install_requires requirements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 1081: Environment markers indicated in ``install_requires``
  are now processed and treated as nameless ``extras_require``
  with markers, allowing their metadata in requires.txt to be
  correctly generated.

* 1053: Tagged commits are now released using Travis-CI
  build stages, meaning releases depend on passing tests on
  all supported Python versions (Linux) and not just the latest
  Python version.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Correct ``py31compat.makedirs`` to correctly honor
  ``exist_ok`` parameter.
* 1083: Also use makedirs compatibility throughout setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Avoid race condition on directory creation in
  ``pkg_resources.ensure_directory``.

* Removed deprecation of and restored support for
  ``upload_docs`` command for sites other than PyPI.
  Only warehouse is dropping support, but services like
  `devpi &lt;http://doc.devpi.net/latest/&gt;`_ continue to
  support docs built by setuptools&#39; plugins. See
  `this comment &lt;https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/devpi/issues/388/support-rtd-model-for-building-uploadingcomment-34292423&gt;`_
  for more context on the motivation for this change.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 1042: Fix import in py27compat module that still
  referenced six directly, rather than through the externs
  module (vendored packages hook).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 980 and others: Once again, Setuptools vendors all
  of its dependencies. It seems to be the case that in
  the Python ecosystem, all build tools must run without
  any dependencies (build, runtime, or otherwise). At
  such a point that a mechanism exists that allows
  build tools to have dependencies, Setuptools will adopt
  it.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 1015: Fix test failures on Python 3.7.

* 1024: Add workaround for Jython 2581 in monkey module.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 992: Revert change introduced in v34.4.1, now
  considered invalid.

* 1016: Revert change introduced in v35.0.0 per 1014,
  referencing 436. The approach had unintended
  consequences, causing sdist installs to be missing
  files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 436: In egg_info.manifest_maker, no longer read
  the file list from the manifest file, and instead
  re-build it on each build. In this way, files removed
  from the specification will not linger in the manifest.
  As a result, any files manually added to the manifest
  will be removed on subsequent egg_info invocations.
  No projects should be manually adding files to the
  manifest and should instead use MANIFEST.in or SCM
  file finders to force inclusion of files in the manifest.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.1
   ```
   -------

* 1008: In MSVC support, use always the last version available for Windows SDK and UCRT SDK.

* 1008: In MSVC support, fix &quot;vcruntime140.dll&quot; returned path with Visual Studio 2017.

* 992: In msvc.msvc9_query_vcvarsall, ensure the
  returned dicts have str values and not Unicode for
  compatibility with os.environ.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 995: In MSVC support, add support for &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio 2017&quot; and &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools 2017&quot;.

* 999 via 1007: Extend support for declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file to include the options
  ``python_requires`` and ``py_modules``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.3
   ```
   -------

* 967 (and 997): Explicitly import submodules of
  packaging to account for environments where the imports
  of those submodules is not implied by other behavior.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.2
   ```
   -------

* 993: Fix documentation upload by correcting
  rendering of content-type in _build_multipart
  on Python 3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 988: Trap ``os.unlink`` same as ``os.remove`` in
  ``auto_chmod`` error handler.

* 983: Fixes to invalid escape sequence deprecations on
  Python 3.6.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 941: In the upload command, if the username is blank,
  default to ``getpass.getuser()``.

* 971: Correct distutils findall monkeypatch to match
  appropriate versions (namely Python 3.4.6).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 966: Add support for reading dist-info metadata and
  thus locating Distributions from zip files.

* 968: Allow &#39;+&#39; and &#39;!&#39; in egg fragments
  so that it can take package names that contain
  PEP 440 conforming version specifiers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 953: More aggressively employ the compatibility issue
  originally added in 706.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 930: ``build_info`` now accepts two new parameters
  to optimize and customize the building of C libraries.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.3
   ```
   -------

* 947: Loosen restriction on the version of six required,
  restoring compatibility with environments relying on
  six 1.6.0 and later.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 882: Ensure extras are honored when building the
  working set.
* 913: Fix issue in develop if package directory has
  a trailing slash.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 935: Fix glob syntax in graft.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 581: Instead of vendoring the growing list of
  dependencies that Setuptools requires to function,
  Setuptools now requires these dependencies just like
  any other project. Unlike other projects, however,
  Setuptools cannot rely on ``setup_requires`` to
  demand the dependencies it needs to install because
  its own machinery would be necessary to pull those
  dependencies if not present (a bootstrapping problem).
  As a result, Setuptools no longer supports self upgrade or
  installation in the general case. Instead, users are
  directed to use pip to install and upgrade using the
  ``wheel`` distributions of setuptools.

  Users are welcome to contrive other means to install
  or upgrade Setuptools using other means, such as
  pre-installing the Setuptools dependencies with pip
  or a bespoke bootstrap tool, but such usage is not
  recommended and is not supported.

  As discovered in 940, not all versions of pip will
  successfully install Setuptools from its pre-built
  wheel. If you encounter issues with &quot;No module named
  six&quot; or &quot;No module named packaging&quot;, especially
  following a line &quot;Running setup.py egg_info for package
  setuptools&quot;, then your pip is not new enough.

  There&#39;s an additional issue in pip where setuptools
  is upgraded concurrently with other source packages,
  described in pip 4253. The proposed workaround is to
  always upgrade Setuptools first prior to upgrading
  other packages that would upgrade Setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 921: Correct issue where certifi fallback not being
  reached on Windows.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.0
   ```
   -------

Installation via pip, as indicated in the `Python Packaging
User&#39;s Guide &lt;https://packaging.python.org/installing/&gt;`_,
is the officially-supported mechanism for installing
Setuptools, and this recommendation is now explicit in the
much more concise README.

Other edits and tweaks were made to the documentation. The
codebase is unchanged.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 619: Removed support for the ``tag_svn_revision``
  distribution option. If Subversion tagging support is
  still desired, consider adding the functionality to
  setuptools_svn in setuptools_svn 2.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 866: Use ``dis.Bytecode`` on Python 3.4 and later in
  ``setuptools.depends``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 889: Backport proposed fix for disabling interpolation in
  distutils.Distribution.parse_config_files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 884: Restore support for running the tests under
  `pytest-runner &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner&gt;`_
  by ensuring that PYTHONPATH is honored in tests invoking
  a subprocess.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.3
   ```
   -------

* 706: Add rmtree compatibility shim for environments where
  rmtree fails when passed a unicode string.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.2
   ```
   -------

* 893: Only release sdist in zip format as warehouse now
  disallows releasing two different formats.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 704: More selectively ensure that &#39;rmtree&#39; is not invoked with
  a byte string, enabling it to remove files that are non-ascii,
  even on Python 2.

* 712: In &#39;sandbox.run_setup&#39;, ensure that ``__file__`` is
  always a ``str``, modeling the behavior observed by the
  interpreter when invoking scripts and modules.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 891: In &#39;test&#39; command on test failure, raise DistutilsError,
  suppression invocation of subsequent commands.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 890: Revert 849. ``global-exclude .foo`` will not match all
  ``*.foo`` files any more. Package authors must add an explicit
  wildcard, such as ``global-exclude *.foo``, to match all
  ``.foo`` files. See 886, 849.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 885: Fix regression where &#39;pkg_resources._rebuild_mod_path&#39;
  would fail when a namespace package&#39;s &#39;__path__&#39; was not
  a list with a sort attribute.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 250: Install &#39;-nspkg.pth&#39; files for packages installed
  with &#39;setup.py develop&#39;. These .pth files allow
  namespace packages installed by pip or develop to
  co-mingle. This change required the removal of the
  change for 805 and pip 1924, introduced in 28.3.0 and implicated
  in 870, but means that namespace packages not in a
  site packages directory will no longer work on Python
  earlier than 3.5, whereas before they would work on
  Python not earlier than 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 879: For declarative config:

  - read_configuration() now accepts ignore_option_errors argument. This allows scraping tools to read metadata without a need to download entire packages. E.g. we can gather some stats right from GitHub repos just by downloading setup.cfg.

  - packages find: directive now supports fine tuning from a subsection. The same arguments as for find() are accepted.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 394 via 862: Added support for `declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file
  &lt;https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.htmlconfiguring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files&gt;`_.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.1
   ```
   -------

* 850: In test command, invoke unittest.main with
  indication not to exit the process.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 854: Bump to vendored Packaging 16.8.

   ### 3.3.0
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.3.0 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Add support for Python 3.6 (via dependencies). **Note** Flake8 does not

You can view the `3.2.1 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Fix subtle bug when deciding whether to report an on-by-default&#39;s violation
  (See also `GitLab257`_)

- Fix another bug around SyntaxErrors not being reported at the right column
  and row (See also `GitLab259`_ and `GitLab237`_ for a related, previously
  fixed bug)

- Fix regression from 2.x where we run checks against explicitly provided
  files, even if they don&#39;t match the filename patterns. (See also
  `GitLab266`_)

   ### 3.1.1
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.1 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Do not attempt to install/distribute a ``man`` file with the Python package;
  leave this for others to do. (See also `GitLab254`_)

- Fix packaging bug where wheel version constraints specified in setup.cfg did
  not match the constraints in setup.py. (See also `GitLab255`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.1.0
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.0 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Add ``--bug-report`` flag to make issue reporters&#39; lives easier.

- Collect configuration files from the current directory when using our Git
  hook. (See also `GitLab210`_, `GitLab218`_, `GitLab223`_)

- Avoid unhandled exceptions when dealing with SyntaxErrors. (See also
  `GitLab214`_, `GitLab238`_)

- Exit early if the value for ``--diff`` is empty. (See also `GitLab226`_)

- Handle empty ``--stdin-display-name`` values. (See also `GitLab235`_)

- Properly report the column number of Syntax Errors. We were assuming that
  all reports of column numbers were 0-indexed, however, SyntaxErrors report
  the column number as 1-indexed. This caused us to report a column number
  that was 1 past the actual position. Further, when combined with
  SyntaxErrors that occur at a newline, this caused the position to be
  visually off by two. (See also `GitLab237`_)

- Fix the behaviour of ``--enable-extensions``. Previously, items specified
  here were still ignored due to the fact that the off-by-default extension
  codes were being left in the ``ignore`` list. (See also `GitLab239`_)

- Fix problems around ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` behaviour that prevented
  codes that were neither explicitly selected nor explicitly ignored from
  being reported. (See also `GitLab242`_)

- Truly be quiet when the user specifies ``-q`` one or more times. Previously,
  we were showing the if the user specified ``-q`` and ``--show-source``. We
  have fixed this bug. (See also `GitLab245`_)

- Add new File Processor attribute, ``previous_unindented_logical_line`` to
  accommodate pycodestyle 2.1.0. (See also `GitLab246`_)

- When something goes wrong, exit non-zero. (See also `GitLab248`_,
  `GitLab209`_)

- Add ``--tee`` as an option to allow use of ``--output-file`` and printing to
  standard out.

- Allow the git plugin to actually be lazy when collecting files.

- Allow for pycodestyle 2.1 series and pyflakes 1.3 series.

   ### 3.0.4
   ```
   -------------------

- Side-step a Pickling Error when using Flake8 with multiprocessing on Unix
  systems. (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix an Attribute Error raised when dealing with Invalid Syntax. (See also
  `GitLab203`_)

- Fix an unhandled Syntax Error when tokenizing files. (See also
  `GitLab205`_)

   ### 3.0.3
   ```
   -------------------

- Disable ``--jobs`` for any version of Python on Windows.
  (See also `this Python bug report`_)

- Raise exception when entry_point in plugin not callable.
  This raises an informative error when a plugin fails to load because its
  entry_point is not callable, which can happen with a plugin which is buggy or
  not updated for the current version of flake8. This is nicer than raising a
  `PicklingError` about failing to pickle a module (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix `` noqa`` comments followed by a ``:`` and explanation broken by
  3.0.0 (See also `GitLab178`_)

- Always open our output file in append mode so we do not overwrite log
  messages. (See also `GitLab193`_)

- When normalizing path values read from configuration, keep in context the
  directory where the configuration was found so that relative paths work.
  (See also `GitLab194`_)

- Fix issue where users were unable to ignore plugin errors that were on
  by default. (See also `GitLab195`_)

- Fix our legacy API StyleGuide&#39;s ``init_report`` method to actually override
  the previous formatter. (See also `GitLab200`_)

   ### 3.0.2
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix local config file discovery.  (See also `GitLab181`_)

- Fix indexing of column numbers. We accidentally were starting column indices
  at 0 instead of 1.

- Fix regression in handling of errors like E402 that rely on a combination of
  attributes. (See also `GitLab186`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.1
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix regression in handling of `` noqa`` for multiline strings.
  (See also `GitLab177`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--output-file`` when not also using
  ``--verbose``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--quiet``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--statistics``. (See also `GitLab180`_)


.. links
.. _GitLab177:
    https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/177
.. _GitLab180:
    https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/180
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   -------------------

- Rewrite our documentation from scratch! (http://flake8.pycqa.org)

- Drop explicit support for Pythons 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3.

- Remove dependence on pep8/pycodestyle for file processing, plugin
  dispatching, and more. We now control all of this while keeping backwards
  compatibility.

- ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` can now both be specified and try to find the
  most specific rule from each. For example, if you do ``--select E --ignore
  E123`` then we will report everything that starts with ``E`` except for
  ``E123``. Previously, you would have had to do ``--ignore E123,F,W`` which
  will also still work, but the former should be far more intuitive.

- Add support for in-line `` noqa`` comments to specify **only** the error
  codes to be ignored, e.g., `` noqa: E123,W503``

- Add entry-point for formatters as well as a base class that new formatters
  can inherit from. See the documentation for more details.

- Add detailed verbose output using the standard library logging module.

- Enhance our usage of optparse for plugin developers by adding new parameters
  to the ``add_option`` that plugins use to register new options.

- Update ``--install-hook`` to require the name of version control system hook
  you wish to install a Flake8.

- Stop checking sub-directories more than once via the setuptools command

- When passing a file on standard-in, allow the caller to specify
  ``--stdin-display-name`` so the output is properly formatted

- The Git hook now uses ``sys.executable`` to format the shebang line.
  This allows Flake8 to install a hook script from a virtualenv that points to
  that virtualenv&#39;s Flake8 as opposed to a global one (without the virtualenv
  being sourced).

- Print results in a deterministic and consistent ordering when used with
  multiprocessing

- When using ``--count``, the output is no longer written to stderr.

- AST plugins can either be functions or classes and all plugins can now
  register options so long as there are callable attributes named as we
  expect.

- Stop forcibly re-adding ``.tox``, ``.eggs``, and ``*.eggs`` to
  ``--exclude``. Flake8 2.x started always appending those three patterns
  to any exclude list (including the default and any user supplied list).
  Flake8 3 has stopped adding these in, so you may see errors when upgrading
  due to these patterns no longer being forcibly excluded by default if you
  have your own exclude patterns specified.

  To fix this, add the appropriate patterns to your exclude patterns list.

  .. note::

      This item was added in November of 2016, as a result of a bug
      report.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.6.1
   ```
   ------------------

  ``tox.ini``. This was broken in 2.5.5 when we stopped passing
  ``config_file`` to our Style Guide
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.6.0
   ```
   ------------------

   ### 2.4.0
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Print filenames when using multiprocessing and ``-q`` option.
  (`GitLab31`_)

- **Improvement** Print warnings for users who are providing mutually
  exclusive options to flake8. (`GitLab8`_, `GitLab!18`_)

- **Feature** Allow git hook configuration to live in ``.git/config``.
  See the updated `VCS hooks docs`_ for more details. (`GitLab!20`_)

  Multiprocessing is forcibly disabled in the following cases:

  - Passing something in via stdin

  - Analyzing a diff

  - Using windows

- Fix --install-hook when there are no config files present for pep8 or
  flake8.

- Fix how the setuptools command parses excludes in config files

   ### 0.31.0
   ```
   ======

- Removed the (already defunct) ``tool`` extras from setup.py
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.30.0
   ```
   ======
- Added py-limited-api {cp32|cp33|cp34|...} flag to produce cpNN.abi3.{arch}
  tags on CPython 3.
- Documented the ``license_file`` metadata key
- Improved Python, abi tagging for `wheel convert`. Thanks Ales Erjavec.
- Fixed `&gt;` being prepended to lines starting with &quot;From&quot; in the long description
- Added support for specifying a build number (as per PEP 427).
  Thanks Ian Cordasco.
- Made the order of files in generated ZIP files deterministic.
  Thanks Matthias Bach.
- Made the order of requirements in metadata deterministic. Thanks Chris Lamb.
- Fixed `wheel install` clobbering existing files
- Improved the error message when trying to verify an unsigned wheel file
- Removed support for Python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.29.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix compression type of files in archive (Issue 155, Pull Request 62,
  thanks Xavier Fernandez)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.28.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix file modes in archive (Issue 154)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.27.0
   ```
   ======
- Support forcing a platform tag using `--plat-name` on pure-Python wheels, as
  well as nonstandard platform tags on non-pure wheels (Pull Request 60, Issue
  144, thanks AndrÃ©s DÃ­az)
- Add SOABI tags to platform-specific wheels built for Python 2.X (Pull Request
  55, Issue 63, Issue 101)
- Support reproducible wheel files, wheels that can be rebuilt and will hash to
  the same values as previous builds (Pull Request 52, Issue 143, thanks
  Barry Warsaw)
- Support for changes in keyring &gt;= 8.0 (Pull Request 61, thanks Jason R.
  Coombs)
- Use the file context manager when checking if dependency_links.txt is empty,
  fixes problems building wheels under PyPy on Windows  (Issue 150, thanks
  Cosimo Lupo)
- Don&#39;t attempt to (recursively) create a build directory ending with `..`
  (invalid on all platforms, but code was only executed on Windows) (Issue 91)
- Added the PyPA Code of Conduct (Pull Request 56)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.26.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix multiple entrypoint comparison failure on Python 3 (Issue 148)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.25.0
   ```
   ======
- Add Python 3.5 to tox configuration
- Deterministic (sorted) metadata
- Fix tagging for Python 3.5 compatibility
- Support py2-none-&#39;arch&#39; and py3-none-&#39;arch&#39; tags
- Treat data-only wheels as pure
- Write to temporary file and rename when using wheel install --force
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.24.0
   ```
   ======
- The python tag used for pure-python packages is now .pyN (major version
  only). This change actually occurred in 0.23.0 when the --python-tag
  option was added, but was not explicitly mentioned in the changelog then.
- wininst2wheel and egg2wheel removed. Use &quot;wheel convert [archive]&quot;
  instead.
- Wheel now supports setuptools style conditional requirements via the
  extras_require={} syntax. Separate &#39;extra&#39; names from conditions using
  the : character. Wheel&#39;s own setup.py does this. (The empty-string
  extra is the same as install_requires.) These conditional requirements
  should work the same whether the package is installed by wheel or
  by setup.py.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.23.0
   ```
   ======
- Compatibility tag flags added to the bdist_wheel command
- sdist should include files necessary for tests
- &#39;wheel convert&#39; can now also convert unpacked eggs to wheel
- Rename pydist.json to metadata.json to avoid stepping on the PEP
- The --skip-scripts option has been removed, and not generating scripts is now
  the default. The option was a temporary approach until installers could
  generate scripts themselves. That is now the case with pip 1.5 and later.
  Note that using pip 1.4 to install a wheel without scripts will leave the
  installation without entry-point wrappers. The &quot;wheel install-scripts&quot;
  command can be used to generate the scripts in such cases.
- Thank you contributors
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.22.0
   ```
   ======
- Include entry_points.txt, scripts a.k.a. commands, in experimental
  pydist.json
- Improved test_requires parsing
- Python 2.6 fixes, &quot;wheel version&quot; command courtesy pombredanne
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.21.0
   ```
   ======
- Pregenerated scripts are the default again.
- &quot;setup.py bdist_wheel --skip-scripts&quot; turns them off.
- setuptools is no longer a listed requirement for the &#39;wheel&#39;
  package. It is of course still required in order for bdist_wheel
  to work.
- &quot;python -m wheel&quot; avoids importing pkg_resources until it&#39;s necessary.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.20.0
   ```
   ======
- No longer include console_scripts in wheels. Ordinary scripts (shell files,
  standalone Python files) are included as usual.
- Include new command &quot;python -m wheel install-scripts [distribution
  [distribution ...]]&quot; to install the console_scripts (setuptools-style
  scripts using pkg_resources) for a distribution.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.19.0
   ```
   ======
- pymeta.json becomes pydist.json
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.18.0
   ```
   ======
- Python 3 Unicode improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.17.0
   ```
   ======
- Support latest PEP-426 &quot;pymeta.json&quot; (json-format metadata)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.16.0
   ```
   ======
- Python 2.6 compatibility bugfix (thanks John McFarlane)
- Non-prerelease version number
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.15.0
   ```
   ======
- Various improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.14.0
   ```
   ======
- Changed the signature format to better comply with the current JWS spec.
  Breaks all existing signatures.
- Include ``wheel unsign`` command to remove RECORD.jws from an archive.
- Put the description in the newly allowed payload section of PKG-INFO
  (METADATA) files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.13.0
   ```
   ======
- Use distutils instead of sysconfig to get installation paths; can install
  headers.
- Improve WheelFile() sort.
- Allow bootstrap installs without any pkg_resources.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.12.0
   ```
   ======
- Unit test for wheel.tool.install
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.11.0
   ```
   ======

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   ======
- Preserve attributes on install.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.10.0
   ```
   ======
- Include a copy of pkg_resources. Wheel can now install into a virtualenv
  that does not have distribute (though most packages still require
  pkg_resources to actually work; wheel install distribute)
- Define a new setup.cfg section [wheel]. universal=1 will
  apply the py2.py3-none-any tag for pure python wheels.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.7
   ```
   =====
- Only import dirspec when needed. dirspec is only needed to find the
  configuration for keygen/signing operations.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.6
   ```
   =====
- requires-dist from setup.cfg overwrites any requirements from setup.py
  Care must be taken that the requirements are the same in both cases,
  or just always install from wheel.
- drop dirspec requirement on win32
- improved command line utility, adds &#39;wheel convert [egg or wininst]&#39; to
  convert legacy binary formats to wheel
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.5
   ```
   =====
- Wheel&#39;s own wheel file can be executed by Python, and can install itself:
  ``python wheel-0.9.5-py27-none-any/wheel install ...``
- Use argparse; basic ``wheel install`` command should run with only stdlib
  dependencies.
- Allow requires_dist in setup.cfg&#39;s [metadata] section. In addition to
  dependencies in setup.py, but will only be interpreted when installing
  from wheel, not from sdist. Can be qualified with environment markers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.4
   ```
   =====
- Fix wheel.signatures in sdist
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.3
   ```
   =====
- Integrated digital signatures support without C extensions.
- Integrated &quot;wheel install&quot; command (single package, no dependency
  resolution) including compatibility check.
- Support Python 3.3
- Use Metadata 1.3 (PEP 426)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.2
   ```
   =====
- Automatic signing if WHEEL_TOOL points to the wheel binary
- Even more Python 3 fixes
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.1
   ```
   =====
- &#39;wheel sign&#39; uses the keys generated by &#39;wheel keygen&#39; (instead of generating

  unordered sequences (sets or dicts).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 37.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 878: Drop support for Python 2.6. Python 2.6 users should

  metadata.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.5.0
   ```
   -------

* 170: When working with Mercurial checkouts, use Windows-friendly
  syntax for suppressing output.

* Inspired by 1134, performed substantial refactoring of
  ``pkg_resources.find_on_path`` to facilitate an optimization
  for paths with many non-version entries.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 1075: Add new ``Description-Content-Type`` metadata field. `See here for
  documentation on how to use this field.
  &lt;https://packaging.python.org/specifications/description-content-type&gt;`_

* 1068: Sort files and directories when building eggs for
  deterministic order.

* 196: Remove caching of easy_install command in fetch_build_egg.
  Fixes issue where ``pytest-runner-N.N`` would satisfy the installation
  of ``pytest``.

* 1129: Fix working set dependencies handling when replacing conflicting
  distributions (e.g. when using ``setup_requires`` with a conflicting
  transitive dependency, fix 1124).

* 1133: Improved handling of README files extensions and added
  Markdown to the list of searched READMES.

* 1135: Improve performance of pkg_resources import by not invoking
  ``access`` or ``stat`` and using ``os.listdir`` instead.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 1131: Make possible using several files within ``file:`` directive
  in metadata.long_description in ``setup.cfg``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.7
   ```
   -------

* fix 1105: Fix handling of requirements with environment
  markers when declared in ``setup.cfg`` (same treatment as
  for 1081).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.6
   ```
   -------

* 462: Don&#39;t assume a directory is an egg by the ``.egg``
  extension alone.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.5
   ```
   -------

* 1093: Fix test command handler with extras_require.
* 1112, 1091, 1115: Now using Trusty containers in
  Travis for CI and CD.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.4
   ```
   -------

* 1092: ``pkg_resources`` now uses ``inspect.getmro`` to
  resolve classes in method resolution order.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.3
   ```
   -------

* 1102: Restore behavior for empty extras.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.2
   ```
   -------

* 1099: Revert commit a3ec721, restoring intended purpose of
  extras as part of a requirement declaration.

* fix 1086
* fix 1087
* support extras specifiers in install_requires requirements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 1081: Environment markers indicated in ``install_requires``
  are now processed and treated as nameless ``extras_require``
  with markers, allowing their metadata in requires.txt to be
  correctly generated.

* 1053: Tagged commits are now released using Travis-CI
  build stages, meaning releases depend on passing tests on
  all supported Python versions (Linux) and not just the latest
  Python version.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Correct ``py31compat.makedirs`` to correctly honor
  ``exist_ok`` parameter.
* 1083: Also use makedirs compatibility throughout setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Avoid race condition on directory creation in
  ``pkg_resources.ensure_directory``.

* Removed deprecation of and restored support for
  ``upload_docs`` command for sites other than PyPI.
  Only warehouse is dropping support, but services like
  `devpi &lt;http://doc.devpi.net/latest/&gt;`_ continue to
  support docs built by setuptools&#39; plugins. See
  `this comment &lt;https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/devpi/issues/388/support-rtd-model-for-building-uploadingcomment-34292423&gt;`_
  for more context on the motivation for this change.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 1042: Fix import in py27compat module that still
  referenced six directly, rather than through the externs
  module (vendored packages hook).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 980 and others: Once again, Setuptools vendors all
  of its dependencies. It seems to be the case that in
  the Python ecosystem, all build tools must run without
  any dependencies (build, runtime, or otherwise). At
  such a point that a mechanism exists that allows
  build tools to have dependencies, Setuptools will adopt
  it.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 1015: Fix test failures on Python 3.7.

* 1024: Add workaround for Jython 2581 in monkey module.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 992: Revert change introduced in v34.4.1, now
  considered invalid.

* 1016: Revert change introduced in v35.0.0 per 1014,
  referencing 436. The approach had unintended
  consequences, causing sdist installs to be missing
  files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 436: In egg_info.manifest_maker, no longer read
  the file list from the manifest file, and instead
  re-build it on each build. In this way, files removed
  from the specification will not linger in the manifest.
  As a result, any files manually added to the manifest
  will be removed on subsequent egg_info invocations.
  No projects should be manually adding files to the
  manifest and should instead use MANIFEST.in or SCM
  file finders to force inclusion of files in the manifest.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.1
   ```
   -------

* 1008: In MSVC support, use always the last version available for Windows SDK and UCRT SDK.

* 1008: In MSVC support, fix &quot;vcruntime140.dll&quot; returned path with Visual Studio 2017.

* 992: In msvc.msvc9_query_vcvarsall, ensure the
  returned dicts have str values and not Unicode for
  compatibility with os.environ.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 995: In MSVC support, add support for &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio 2017&quot; and &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools 2017&quot;.

* 999 via 1007: Extend support for declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file to include the options
  ``python_requires`` and ``py_modules``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.3
   ```
   -------

* 967 (and 997): Explicitly import submodules of
  packaging to account for environments where the imports
  of those submodules is not implied by other behavior.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.2
   ```
   -------

* 993: Fix documentation upload by correcting
  rendering of content-type in _build_multipart
  on Python 3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 988: Trap ``os.unlink`` same as ``os.remove`` in
  ``auto_chmod`` error handler.

* 983: Fixes to invalid escape sequence deprecations on
  Python 3.6.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 941: In the upload command, if the username is blank,
  default to ``getpass.getuser()``.

* 971: Correct distutils findall monkeypatch to match
  appropriate versions (namely Python 3.4.6).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 966: Add support for reading dist-info metadata and
  thus locating Distributions from zip files.

* 968: Allow &#39;+&#39; and &#39;!&#39; in egg fragments
  so that it can take package names that contain
  PEP 440 conforming version specifiers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 953: More aggressively employ the compatibility issue
  originally added in 706.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 930: ``build_info`` now accepts two new parameters
  to optimize and customize the building of C libraries.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.3
   ```
   -------

* 947: Loosen restriction on the version of six required,
  restoring compatibility with environments relying on
  six 1.6.0 and later.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 882: Ensure extras are honored when building the
  working set.
* 913: Fix issue in develop if package directory has
  a trailing slash.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 935: Fix glob syntax in graft.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 581: Instead of vendoring the growing list of
  dependencies that Setuptools requires to function,
  Setuptools now requires these dependencies just like
  any other project. Unlike other projects, however,
  Setuptools cannot rely on ``setup_requires`` to
  demand the dependencies it needs to install because
  its own machinery would be necessary to pull those
  dependencies if not present (a bootstrapping problem).
  As a result, Setuptools no longer supports self upgrade or
  installation in the general case. Instead, users are
  directed to use pip to install and upgrade using the
  ``wheel`` distributions of setuptools.

  Users are welcome to contrive other means to install
  or upgrade Setuptools using other means, such as
  pre-installing the Setuptools dependencies with pip
  or a bespoke bootstrap tool, but such usage is not
  recommended and is not supported.

  As discovered in 940, not all versions of pip will
  successfully install Setuptools from its pre-built
  wheel. If you encounter issues with &quot;No module named
  six&quot; or &quot;No module named packaging&quot;, especially
  following a line &quot;Running setup.py egg_info for package
  setuptools&quot;, then your pip is not new enough.

  There&#39;s an additional issue in pip where setuptools
  is upgraded concurrently with other source packages,
  described in pip 4253. The proposed workaround is to
  always upgrade Setuptools first prior to upgrading
  other packages that would upgrade Setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 921: Correct issue where certifi fallback not being
  reached on Windows.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.0
   ```
   -------

Installation via pip, as indicated in the `Python Packaging
User&#39;s Guide &lt;https://packaging.python.org/installing/&gt;`_,
is the officially-supported mechanism for installing
Setuptools, and this recommendation is now explicit in the
much more concise README.

Other edits and tweaks were made to the documentation. The
codebase is unchanged.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 619: Removed support for the ``tag_svn_revision``
  distribution option. If Subversion tagging support is
  still desired, consider adding the functionality to
  setuptools_svn in setuptools_svn 2.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 866: Use ``dis.Bytecode`` on Python 3.4 and later in
  ``setuptools.depends``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 889: Backport proposed fix for disabling interpolation in
  distutils.Distribution.parse_config_files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 884: Restore support for running the tests under
  `pytest-runner &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner&gt;`_
  by ensuring that PYTHONPATH is honored in tests invoking
  a subprocess.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.3
   ```
   -------

* 706: Add rmtree compatibility shim for environments where
  rmtree fails when passed a unicode string.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.2
   ```
   -------

* 893: Only release sdist in zip format as warehouse now
  disallows releasing two different formats.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 704: More selectively ensure that &#39;rmtree&#39; is not invoked with
  a byte string, enabling it to remove files that are non-ascii,
  even on Python 2.

* 712: In &#39;sandbox.run_setup&#39;, ensure that ``__file__`` is
  always a ``str``, modeling the behavior observed by the
  interpreter when invoking scripts and modules.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 891: In &#39;test&#39; command on test failure, raise DistutilsError,
  suppression invocation of subsequent commands.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 890: Revert 849. ``global-exclude .foo`` will not match all
  ``*.foo`` files any more. Package authors must add an explicit
  wildcard, such as ``global-exclude *.foo``, to match all
  ``.foo`` files. See 886, 849.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 885: Fix regression where &#39;pkg_resources._rebuild_mod_path&#39;
  would fail when a namespace package&#39;s &#39;__path__&#39; was not
  a list with a sort attribute.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 250: Install &#39;-nspkg.pth&#39; files for packages installed
  with &#39;setup.py develop&#39;. These .pth files allow
  namespace packages installed by pip or develop to
  co-mingle. This change required the removal of the
  change for 805 and pip 1924, introduced in 28.3.0 and implicated
  in 870, but means that namespace packages not in a
  site packages directory will no longer work on Python
  earlier than 3.5, whereas before they would work on
  Python not earlier than 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 879: For declarative config:

  - read_configuration() now accepts ignore_option_errors argument. This allows scraping tools to read metadata without a need to download entire packages. E.g. we can gather some stats right from GitHub repos just by downloading setup.cfg.

  - packages find: directive now supports fine tuning from a subsection. The same arguments as for find() are accepted.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 394 via 862: Added support for `declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file
  &lt;https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.htmlconfiguring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files&gt;`_.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.1
   ```
   -------

* 850: In test command, invoke unittest.main with
  indication not to exit the process.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 854: Bump to vendored Packaging 16.8.

You can view the `3.2.1 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Fix subtle bug when deciding whether to report an on-by-default&#39;s violation
  (See also `GitLab257`_)

- Fix another bug around SyntaxErrors not being reported at the right column
  and row (See also `GitLab259`_ and `GitLab237`_ for a related, previously
  fixed bug)

- Fix regression from 2.x where we run checks against explicitly provided
  files, even if they don&#39;t match the filename patterns. (See also
  `GitLab266`_)

   ### 3.1.1
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.1 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Do not attempt to install/distribute a ``man`` file with the Python package;
  leave this for others to do. (See also `GitLab254`_)

- Fix packaging bug where wheel version constraints specified in setup.cfg did
  not match the constraints in setup.py. (See also `GitLab255`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.1.0
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.0 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Add ``--bug-report`` flag to make issue reporters&#39; lives easier.

- Collect configuration files from the current directory when using our Git
  hook. (See also `GitLab210`_, `GitLab218`_, `GitLab223`_)

- Avoid unhandled exceptions when dealing with SyntaxErrors. (See also
  `GitLab214`_, `GitLab238`_)

- Exit early if the value for ``--diff`` is empty. (See also `GitLab226`_)

- Handle empty ``--stdin-display-name`` values. (See also `GitLab235`_)

- Properly report the column number of Syntax Errors. We were assuming that
  all reports of column numbers were 0-indexed, however, SyntaxErrors report
  the column number as 1-indexed. This caused us to report a column number
  that was 1 past the actual position. Further, when combined with
  SyntaxErrors that occur at a newline, this caused the position to be
  visually off by two. (See also `GitLab237`_)

- Fix the behaviour of ``--enable-extensions``. Previously, items specified
  here were still ignored due to the fact that the off-by-default extension
  codes were being left in the ``ignore`` list. (See also `GitLab239`_)

- Fix problems around ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` behaviour that prevented
  codes that were neither explicitly selected nor explicitly ignored from
  being reported. (See also `GitLab242`_)

- Truly be quiet when the user specifies ``-q`` one or more times. Previously,
  we were showing the if the user specified ``-q`` and ``--show-source``. We
  have fixed this bug. (See also `GitLab245`_)

- Add new File Processor attribute, ``previous_unindented_logical_line`` to
  accommodate pycodestyle 2.1.0. (See also `GitLab246`_)

- When something goes wrong, exit non-zero. (See also `GitLab248`_,
  `GitLab209`_)

- Add ``--tee`` as an option to allow use of ``--output-file`` and printing to
  standard out.

- Allow the git plugin to actually be lazy when collecting files.

- Allow for pycodestyle 2.1 series and pyflakes 1.3 series.

   ### 3.0.4
   ```
   -------------------

- Side-step a Pickling Error when using Flake8 with multiprocessing on Unix
  systems. (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix an Attribute Error raised when dealing with Invalid Syntax. (See also
  `GitLab203`_)

- Fix an unhandled Syntax Error when tokenizing files. (See also
  `GitLab205`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.3
   ```
   -------------------

- Disable ``--jobs`` for any version of Python on Windows.
  (See also `this Python bug report`_)

- Raise exception when entry_point in plugin not callable.
  This raises an informative error when a plugin fails to load because its
  entry_point is not callable, which can happen with a plugin which is buggy or
  not updated for the current version of flake8. This is nicer than raising a
  `PicklingError` about failing to pickle a module (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix `` noqa`` comments followed by a ``:`` and explanation broken by
  3.0.0 (See also `GitLab178`_)

- Always open our output file in append mode so we do not overwrite log
  messages. (See also `GitLab193`_)

- When normalizing path values read from configuration, keep in context the
  directory where the configuration was found so that relative paths work.
  (See also `GitLab194`_)

- Fix issue where users were unable to ignore plugin errors that were on
  by default. (See also `GitLab195`_)

- Fix our legacy API StyleGuide&#39;s ``init_report`` method to actually override
  the previous formatter. (See also `GitLab200`_)

   ### 3.0.2
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix local config file discovery.  (See also `GitLab181`_)

- Fix indexing of column numbers. We accidentally were starting column indices
  at 0 instead of 1.

- Fix regression in handling of errors like E402 that rely on a combination of
  attributes. (See also `GitLab186`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.1
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix regression in handling of `` noqa`` for multiline strings.
  (See also `GitLab177`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--output-file`` when not also using
  ``--verbose``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--quiet``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--statistics``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

    https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/177
.. _GitLab180:
    https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/180
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   -------------------

- Rewrite our documentation from scratch! (http://flake8.pycqa.org)

- Drop explicit support for Pythons 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3.

- Remove dependence on pep8/pycodestyle for file processing, plugin
  dispatching, and more. We now control all of this while keeping backwards
  compatibility.

- ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` can now both be specified and try to find the
  most specific rule from each. For example, if you do ``--select E --ignore
  E123`` then we will report everything that starts with ``E`` except for
  ``E123``. Previously, you would have had to do ``--ignore E123,F,W`` which
  will also still work, but the former should be far more intuitive.

- Add support for in-line `` noqa`` comments to specify **only** the error
  codes to be ignored, e.g., `` noqa: E123,W503``

- Add entry-point for formatters as well as a base class that new formatters
  can inherit from. See the documentation for more details.

- Add detailed verbose output using the standard library logging module.

- Enhance our usage of optparse for plugin developers by adding new parameters
  to the ``add_option`` that plugins use to register new options.

- Update ``--install-hook`` to require the name of version control system hook
  you wish to install a Flake8.

- Stop checking sub-directories more than once via the setuptools command

- When passing a file on standard-in, allow the caller to specify
  ``--stdin-display-name`` so the output is properly formatted

- The Git hook now uses ``sys.executable`` to format the shebang line.
  This allows Flake8 to install a hook script from a virtualenv that points to
  that virtualenv&#39;s Flake8 as opposed to a global one (without the virtualenv
  being sourced).

- Print results in a deterministic and consistent ordering when used with
  multiprocessing

- When using ``--count``, the output is no longer written to stderr.

- AST plugins can either be functions or classes and all plugins can now
  register options so long as there are callable attributes named as we
  expect.

- Stop forcibly re-adding ``.tox``, ``.eggs``, and ``*.eggs`` to
  ``--exclude``. Flake8 2.x started always appending those three patterns
  to any exclude list (including the default and any user supplied list).
  Flake8 3 has stopped adding these in, so you may see errors when upgrading
  due to these patterns no longer being forcibly excluded by default if you
  have your own exclude patterns specified.

  To fix this, add the appropriate patterns to your exclude patterns list.

  .. note::

      This item was added in November of 2016, as a result of a bug
      report.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.6.2
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Fix packaging error during release process.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.6.1
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Update the config files to search for to include ``setup.cfg`` and
  ``tox.ini``. This was broken in 2.5.5 when we stopped passing
  ``config_file`` to our Style Guide
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.6.0
   ```
   ------------------

- **Requirements Change** Switch to pycodestyle as all future pep8 releases
  will use that package name

   ------------------

- **Bug** Properly look for ``.flake8`` in current working directory
  (`GitLab103`_)

- **Bug** Monkey-patch ``pep8.stdin_get_value`` to cache the actual value in
  stdin. This helps plugins relying on the function when run with
  multiprocessing. (`GitLab105`_, `GitLab107`_)

   ### 2.4.0
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Print filenames when using multiprocessing and ``-q`` option.
  (`GitLab31`_)

- **Bug** Put upper cap on dependencies. The caps for 2.4.0 are:

  - ``pep8 &lt; 1.6`` (Related to `GitLab35`_)

  - ``mccabe &lt; 0.4``

  - ``pyflakes &lt; 0.9``

  See also `GitLab32`_

- **Bug** Files excluded in a config file were not being excluded when flake8
  was run from a git hook. (`GitHub2`_)

- **Improvement** Print warnings for users who are providing mutually
  exclusive options to flake8. (`GitLab8`_, `GitLab!18`_)

- **Feature** Allow git hook configuration to live in ``.git/config``.
  See the updated `VCS hooks docs`_ for more details. (`GitLab!20`_)

   ### 2.2.0
   ```
   ------------------

   ```
   ======

- Removed the (already defunct) ``tool`` extras from setup.py
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.30.0
   ```
   ======
- Added py-limited-api {cp32|cp33|cp34|...} flag to produce cpNN.abi3.{arch}
  tags on CPython 3.
- Documented the ``license_file`` metadata key
- Improved Python, abi tagging for `wheel convert`. Thanks Ales Erjavec.
- Fixed `&gt;` being prepended to lines starting with &quot;From&quot; in the long description
- Added support for specifying a build number (as per PEP 427).
  Thanks Ian Cordasco.
- Made the order of files in generated ZIP files deterministic.
  Thanks Matthias Bach.
- Made the order of requirements in metadata deterministic. Thanks Chris Lamb.
- Fixed `wheel install` clobbering existing files
- Improved the error message when trying to verify an unsigned wheel file
- Removed support for Python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.29.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix compression type of files in archive (Issue 155, Pull Request 62,
  thanks Xavier Fernandez)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.28.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix file modes in archive (Issue 154)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.27.0
   ```
   ======
- Support forcing a platform tag using `--plat-name` on pure-Python wheels, as
  well as nonstandard platform tags on non-pure wheels (Pull Request 60, Issue
  144, thanks AndrÃ©s DÃ­az)
- Add SOABI tags to platform-specific wheels built for Python 2.X (Pull Request
  55, Issue 63, Issue 101)
- Support reproducible wheel files, wheels that can be rebuilt and will hash to
  the same values as previous builds (Pull Request 52, Issue 143, thanks
  Barry Warsaw)
- Support for changes in keyring &gt;= 8.0 (Pull Request 61, thanks Jason R.
  Coombs)
- Use the file context manager when checking if dependency_links.txt is empty,
  fixes problems building wheels under PyPy on Windows  (Issue 150, thanks
  Cosimo Lupo)
- Don&#39;t attempt to (recursively) create a build directory ending with `..`
  (invalid on all platforms, but code was only executed on Windows) (Issue 91)
- Added the PyPA Code of Conduct (Pull Request 56)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.26.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix multiple entrypoint comparison failure on Python 3 (Issue 148)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.25.0
   ```
   ======
- Add Python 3.5 to tox configuration
- Deterministic (sorted) metadata
- Fix tagging for Python 3.5 compatibility
- Support py2-none-&#39;arch&#39; and py3-none-&#39;arch&#39; tags
- Treat data-only wheels as pure
- Write to temporary file and rename when using wheel install --force
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.24.0
   ```
   ======
- The python tag used for pure-python packages is now .pyN (major version
  only). This change actually occurred in 0.23.0 when the --python-tag
  option was added, but was not explicitly mentioned in the changelog then.
- wininst2wheel and egg2wheel removed. Use &quot;wheel convert [archive]&quot;
  instead.
- Wheel now supports setuptools style conditional requirements via the
  extras_require={} syntax. Separate &#39;extra&#39; names from conditions using
  the : character. Wheel&#39;s own setup.py does this. (The empty-string
  extra is the same as install_requires.) These conditional requirements
  should work the same whether the package is installed by wheel or
  by setup.py.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.23.0
   ```
   ======
- Compatibility tag flags added to the bdist_wheel command
- sdist should include files necessary for tests
- &#39;wheel convert&#39; can now also convert unpacked eggs to wheel
- Rename pydist.json to metadata.json to avoid stepping on the PEP
- The --skip-scripts option has been removed, and not generating scripts is now
  the default. The option was a temporary approach until installers could
  generate scripts themselves. That is now the case with pip 1.5 and later.
  Note that using pip 1.4 to install a wheel without scripts will leave the
  installation without entry-point wrappers. The &quot;wheel install-scripts&quot;
  command can be used to generate the scripts in such cases.
- Thank you contributors
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.22.0
   ```
   ======
- Include entry_points.txt, scripts a.k.a. commands, in experimental
  pydist.json
- Improved test_requires parsing
- Python 2.6 fixes, &quot;wheel version&quot; command courtesy pombredanne
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.21.0
   ```
   ======
- Pregenerated scripts are the default again.
- &quot;setup.py bdist_wheel --skip-scripts&quot; turns them off.
- setuptools is no longer a listed requirement for the &#39;wheel&#39;
  package. It is of course still required in order for bdist_wheel
  to work.
- &quot;python -m wheel&quot; avoids importing pkg_resources until it&#39;s necessary.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.20.0
   ```
   ======
- No longer include console_scripts in wheels. Ordinary scripts (shell files,
  standalone Python files) are included as usual.
- Include new command &quot;python -m wheel install-scripts [distribution
  [distribution ...]]&quot; to install the console_scripts (setuptools-style
  scripts using pkg_resources) for a distribution.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.19.0
   ```
   ======
- pymeta.json becomes pydist.json
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.18.0
   ```
   ======
- Python 3 Unicode improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.17.0
   ```
   ======
- Support latest PEP-426 &quot;pymeta.json&quot; (json-format metadata)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.16.0
   ```
   ======

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.10.0
   ```
   ======
- Include a copy of pkg_resources. Wheel can now install into a virtualenv
  that does not have distribute (though most packages still require
  pkg_resources to actually work; wheel install distribute)
- Define a new setup.cfg section [wheel]. universal=1 will
  apply the py2.py3-none-any tag for pure python wheels.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.7
   ```
   =====
- Only import dirspec when needed. dirspec is only needed to find the
  configuration for keygen/signing operations.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.6
   ```
   =====
- requires-dist from setup.cfg overwrites any requirements from setup.py
  Care must be taken that the requirements are the same in both cases,
  or just always install from wheel.

- improved command line utility, adds &#39;wheel convert [egg or wininst]&#39; to
  convert legacy binary formats to wheel
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.5
   ```
   =====
- Wheel&#39;s own wheel file can be executed by Python, and can install itself:
  ``python wheel-0.9.5-py27-none-any/wheel install ...``
- Use argparse; basic ``wheel install`` command should run with only stdlib
  dependencies.
- Allow requires_dist in setup.cfg&#39;s [metadata] section. In addition to
  dependencies in setup.py, but will only be interpreted when installing
  from wheel, not from sdist. Can be qualified with environment markers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.4

- Fix wheel.signatures in sdist
   ```

   ```
   =====
- Integrated digital signatures support without C extensions.
- Integrated &quot;wheel install&quot; command (single package, no dependency
  resolution) including compatibility check.

- Even more Python 3 fixes
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.1
   ```
   =====
- &#39;wheel sign&#39; uses the keys generated by &#39;wheel keygen&#39; (instead of generating
  a new key at random each time)
- Python 2/3 encoding/decoding fixes
- Run tests on Python 2.6 (without signature verification)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9
   ```
   ===
- Updated digital signatures scheme
- Python 3 support for digital signatures
- Always verify RECORD hashes on extract
- &quot;wheel&quot; command line tool to sign, verify, unpack wheel files
   ```

   ### 36.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 1081: Environment markers indicated in ``install_requires``
  are now processed and treated as nameless ``extras_require``
  with markers, allowing their metadata in requires.txt to be
  correctly generated.

* 1053: Tagged commits are now released using Travis-CI
  build stages, meaning releases depend on passing tests on
  all supported Python versions (Linux) and not just the latest
  Python version.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Correct ``py31compat.makedirs`` to correctly honor

  Only warehouse is dropping support, but services like
  `devpi &lt;http://doc.devpi.net/latest/&gt;`_ continue to
  support docs built by setuptools&#39; plugins. See
  `this comment &lt;https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/devpi/issues/388/support-rtd-model-for-building-uploadingcomment-34292423&gt;`_
  for more context on the motivation for this change.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 1042: Fix import in py27compat module that still
  referenced six directly, rather than through the externs
  module (vendored packages hook).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 980 and others: Once again, Setuptools vendors all
  of its dependencies. It seems to be the case that in
  the Python ecosystem, all build tools must run without
  any dependencies (build, runtime, or otherwise). At
  such a point that a mechanism exists that allows
  build tools to have dependencies, Setuptools will adopt
  it.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 1015: Fix test failures on Python 3.7.

* 1024: Add workaround for Jython 2581 in monkey module.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 992: Revert change introduced in v34.4.1, now
  considered invalid.

* 1016: Revert change introduced in v35.0.0 per 1014,
  referencing 436. The approach had unintended
  consequences, causing sdist installs to be missing
  files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 436: In egg_info.manifest_maker, no longer read
  the file list from the manifest file, and instead
  re-build it on each build. In this way, files removed
  from the specification will not linger in the manifest.
  As a result, any files manually added to the manifest
  will be removed on subsequent egg_info invocations.
  No projects should be manually adding files to the
  manifest and should instead use MANIFEST.in or SCM
  file finders to force inclusion of files in the manifest.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.1
   ```
   -------

* 1008: In MSVC support, use always the last version available for Windows SDK and UCRT SDK.

* 1008: In MSVC support, fix &quot;vcruntime140.dll&quot; returned path with Visual Studio 2017.

* 992: In msvc.msvc9_query_vcvarsall, ensure the
  returned dicts have str values and not Unicode for
  compatibility with os.environ.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 995: In MSVC support, add support for &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio 2017&quot; and &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools 2017&quot;.

* 999 via 1007: Extend support for declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file to include the options
  ``python_requires`` and ``py_modules``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.3
   ```
   -------

* 967 (and 997): Explicitly import submodules of
  packaging to account for environments where the imports
  of those submodules is not implied by other behavior.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.2
   ```
   -------

* 993: Fix documentation upload by correcting
  rendering of content-type in _build_multipart
  on Python 3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 988: Trap ``os.unlink`` same as ``os.remove`` in
  ``auto_chmod`` error handler.

* 983: Fixes to invalid escape sequence deprecations on
  Python 3.6.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 941: In the upload command, if the username is blank,
  default to ``getpass.getuser()``.

  appropriate versions (namely Python 3.4.6).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.2.0
   ```
   -------

  thus locating Distributions from zip files.

* 968: Allow &#39;+&#39; and &#39;!&#39; in egg fragments
  so that it can take package names that contain
  PEP 440 conforming version specifiers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.1
   ```
   -------

   ### 34.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 581: Instead of vendoring the growing list of
  dependencies that Setuptools requires to function,
  Setuptools now requires these dependencies just like
  any other project. Unlike other projects, however,
  Setuptools cannot rely on ``setup_requires`` to
  demand the dependencies it needs to install because
  its own machinery would be necessary to pull those
  dependencies if not present (a bootstrapping problem).
  As a result, Setuptools no longer supports self upgrade or
  installation in the general case. Instead, users are
  directed to use pip to install and upgrade using the
  ``wheel`` distributions of setuptools.

  Users are welcome to contrive other means to install
  or upgrade Setuptools using other means, such as
  pre-installing the Setuptools dependencies with pip
  or a bespoke bootstrap tool, but such usage is not
  recommended and is not supported.

  As discovered in 940, not all versions of pip will
  successfully install Setuptools from its pre-built
  wheel. If you encounter issues with &quot;No module named
  six&quot; or &quot;No module named packaging&quot;, especially
  following a line &quot;Running setup.py egg_info for package
  setuptools&quot;, then your pip is not new enough.

  There&#39;s an additional issue in pip where setuptools
  is upgraded concurrently with other source packages,
  described in pip 4253. The proposed workaround is to
  always upgrade Setuptools first prior to upgrading
  other packages that would upgrade Setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 921: Correct issue where certifi fallback not being
  reached on Windows.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.0
   ```
   -------

Installation via pip, as indicated in the `Python Packaging
User&#39;s Guide &lt;https://packaging.python.org/installing/&gt;`_,
is the officially-supported mechanism for installing
Setuptools, and this recommendation is now explicit in the
much more concise README.

Other edits and tweaks were made to the documentation. The
codebase is unchanged.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 619: Removed support for the ``tag_svn_revision``
  distribution option. If Subversion tagging support is
  still desired, consider adding the functionality to
  setuptools_svn in setuptools_svn 2.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 866: Use ``dis.Bytecode`` on Python 3.4 and later in
  ``setuptools.depends``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 889: Backport proposed fix for disabling interpolation in
  distutils.Distribution.parse_config_files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 884: Restore support for running the tests under
  `pytest-runner &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner&gt;`_
  by ensuring that PYTHONPATH is honored in tests invoking
  a subprocess.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.3
   ```
   -------

* 706: Add rmtree compatibility shim for environments where
  rmtree fails when passed a unicode string.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.2
   ```
   -------

* 893: Only release sdist in zip format as warehouse now
  disallows releasing two different formats.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 704: More selectively ensure that &#39;rmtree&#39; is not invoked with
  a byte string, enabling it to remove files that are non-ascii,
  even on Python 2.

* 712: In &#39;sandbox.run_setup&#39;, ensure that ``__file__`` is
  always a ``str``, modeling the behavior observed by the
  interpreter when invoking scripts and modules.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 891: In &#39;test&#39; command on test failure, raise DistutilsError,
  suppression invocation of subsequent commands.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 890: Revert 849. ``global-exclude .foo`` will not match all
  ``*.foo`` files any more. Package authors must add an explicit
  wildcard, such as ``global-exclude *.foo``, to match all
  ``.foo`` files. See 886, 849.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 885: Fix regression where &#39;pkg_resources._rebuild_mod_path&#39;
  would fail when a namespace package&#39;s &#39;__path__&#39; was not
  a list with a sort attribute.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 250: Install &#39;-nspkg.pth&#39; files for packages installed
  with &#39;setup.py develop&#39;. These .pth files allow
  namespace packages installed by pip or develop to
  co-mingle. This change required the removal of the
  change for 805 and pip 1924, introduced in 28.3.0 and implicated
  in 870, but means that namespace packages not in a
  site packages directory will no longer work on Python
  earlier than 3.5, whereas before they would work on
  Python not earlier than 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 879: For declarative config:

  - read_configuration() now accepts ignore_option_errors argument. This allows scraping tools to read metadata without a need to download entire packages. E.g. we can gather some stats right from GitHub repos just by downloading setup.cfg.

  - packages find: directive now supports fine tuning from a subsection. The same arguments as for find() are accepted.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 394 via 862: Added support for `declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file
  &lt;https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.htmlconfiguring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files&gt;`_.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.1
   ```
   -------

* 850: In test command, invoke unittest.main with
  indication not to exit the process.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 854: Bump to vendored Packaging 16.8.

   -------------------

You can view the `3.2.1 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Fix subtle bug when deciding whether to report an on-by-default&#39;s violation
  (See also `GitLab257`_)

- Fix another bug around SyntaxErrors not being reported at the right column
  and row (See also `GitLab259`_ and `GitLab237`_ for a related, previously
  fixed bug)

- Fix regression from 2.x where we run checks against explicitly provided
  files, even if they don&#39;t match the filename patterns. (See also

   ### 3.1.1
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.1 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Do not attempt to install/distribute a ``man`` file with the Python package;
  leave this for others to do. (See also `GitLab254`_)

- Fix packaging bug where wheel version constraints specified in setup.cfg did
  not match the constraints in setup.py. (See also `GitLab255`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.1.0
   ```
   -------------------

You can view the `3.1.0 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Add ``--bug-report`` flag to make issue reporters&#39; lives easier.

- Collect configuration files from the current directory when using our Git
  hook. (See also `GitLab210`_, `GitLab218`_, `GitLab223`_)

- Avoid unhandled exceptions when dealing with SyntaxErrors. (See also
  `GitLab214`_, `GitLab238`_)

- Exit early if the value for ``--diff`` is empty. (See also `GitLab226`_)

- Handle empty ``--stdin-display-name`` values. (See also `GitLab235`_)

- Properly report the column number of Syntax Errors. We were assuming that
  all reports of column numbers were 0-indexed, however, SyntaxErrors report
  the column number as 1-indexed. This caused us to report a column number
  that was 1 past the actual position. Further, when combined with
  SyntaxErrors that occur at a newline, this caused the position to be
  visually off by two. (See also `GitLab237`_)

- Fix the behaviour of ``--enable-extensions``. Previously, items specified
  here were still ignored due to the fact that the off-by-default extension
  codes were being left in the ``ignore`` list. (See also `GitLab239`_)

- Fix problems around ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` behaviour that prevented
  codes that were neither explicitly selected nor explicitly ignored from
  being reported. (See also `GitLab242`_)

- Truly be quiet when the user specifies ``-q`` one or more times. Previously,
  we were showing the if the user specified ``-q`` and ``--show-source``. We
  have fixed this bug. (See also `GitLab245`_)

- Add new File Processor attribute, ``previous_unindented_logical_line`` to
  accommodate pycodestyle 2.1.0. (See also `GitLab246`_)

- When something goes wrong, exit non-zero. (See also `GitLab248`_,
  `GitLab209`_)

- Add ``--tee`` as an option to allow use of ``--output-file`` and printing to
  standard out.

- Allow the git plugin to actually be lazy when collecting files.

- Allow for pycodestyle 2.1 series and pyflakes 1.3 series.

   ### 3.0.4
   ```
   -------------------

- Side-step a Pickling Error when using Flake8 with multiprocessing on Unix
  systems. (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix an Attribute Error raised when dealing with Invalid Syntax. (See also
  `GitLab203`_)

- Fix an unhandled Syntax Error when tokenizing files. (See also
  `GitLab205`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.3
   ```
   -------------------

- Disable ``--jobs`` for any version of Python on Windows.
  (See also `this Python bug report`_)

- Raise exception when entry_point in plugin not callable.
  This raises an informative error when a plugin fails to load because its
  entry_point is not callable, which can happen with a plugin which is buggy or
  not updated for the current version of flake8. This is nicer than raising a
  `PicklingError` about failing to pickle a module (See also `GitLab164`_)

- Fix `` noqa`` comments followed by a ``:`` and explanation broken by
  3.0.0 (See also `GitLab178`_)

- Always open our output file in append mode so we do not overwrite log
  messages. (See also `GitLab193`_)

- When normalizing path values read from configuration, keep in context the
  directory where the configuration was found so that relative paths work.
  (See also `GitLab194`_)

- Fix issue where users were unable to ignore plugin errors that were on
  by default. (See also `GitLab195`_)

- Fix our legacy API StyleGuide&#39;s ``init_report`` method to actually override
  the previous formatter. (See also `GitLab200`_)

   ### 3.0.2
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix local config file discovery.  (See also `GitLab181`_)

- Fix indexing of column numbers. We accidentally were starting column indices
  at 0 instead of 1.

- Fix regression in handling of errors like E402 that rely on a combination of
  attributes. (See also `GitLab186`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.1
   ```
   -------------------

- Fix regression in handling of `` noqa`` for multiline strings.
  (See also `GitLab177`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--output-file`` when not also using
  ``--verbose``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--quiet``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

- Fix regression in handling of ``--statistics``. (See also `GitLab180`_)

.. _GitLab180:
    https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/180
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.0.0
   ```
   -------------------

- Rewrite our documentation from scratch! (http://flake8.pycqa.org)

- Drop explicit support for Pythons 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3.

- Remove dependence on pep8/pycodestyle for file processing, plugin
  dispatching, and more. We now control all of this while keeping backwards
  compatibility.

- ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` can now both be specified and try to find the
  most specific rule from each. For example, if you do ``--select E --ignore
  E123`` then we will report everything that starts with ``E`` except for
  ``E123``. Previously, you would have had to do ``--ignore E123,F,W`` which
  will also still work, but the former should be far more intuitive.

- Add support for in-line `` noqa`` comments to specify **only** the error
  codes to be ignored, e.g., `` noqa: E123,W503``

- Add entry-point for formatters as well as a base class that new formatters
  can inherit from. See the documentation for more details.

- Add detailed verbose output using the standard library logging module.

- Enhance our usage of optparse for plugin developers by adding new parameters
  to the ``add_option`` that plugins use to register new options.

- Update ``--install-hook`` to require the name of version control system hook
  you wish to install a Flake8.

- Stop checking sub-directories more than once via the setuptools command

- When passing a file on standard-in, allow the caller to specify
  ``--stdin-display-name`` so the output is properly formatted

- The Git hook now uses ``sys.executable`` to format the shebang line.
  This allows Flake8 to install a hook script from a virtualenv that points to
  that virtualenv&#39;s Flake8 as opposed to a global one (without the virtualenv
  being sourced).

- Print results in a deterministic and consistent ordering when used with
  multiprocessing

- When using ``--count``, the output is no longer written to stderr.

- AST plugins can either be functions or classes and all plugins can now
  register options so long as there are callable attributes named as we
  expect.

- Stop forcibly re-adding ``.tox``, ``.eggs``, and ``*.eggs`` to
  ``--exclude``. Flake8 2.x started always appending those three patterns
  to any exclude list (including the default and any user supplied list).
  Flake8 3 has stopped adding these in, so you may see errors when upgrading
  due to these patterns no longer being forcibly excluded by default if you
  have your own exclude patterns specified.

  To fix this, add the appropriate patterns to your exclude patterns list.

  .. note::

      This item was added in November of 2016, as a result of a bug
      report.

   ### 2.6.2
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Fix packaging error during release process.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.6.1
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Update the config files to search for to include ``setup.cfg`` and
  ``tox.ini``. This was broken in 2.5.5 when we stopped passing
  ``config_file`` to our Style Guide
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.6.0
   ```
   ------------------

- **Requirements Change** Switch to pycodestyle as all future pep8 releases
  will use that package name

  use ``--jobs`` and multiprocessing

- **Improvement** Update bounds on McCabe

- **Improvement** Update bounds on PyFlakes and blacklist known broken
  versions

- **Improvement** Handle new PyFlakes warning with a new error code: F405
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.5.5
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Fix setuptools integration when parsing config files

- **Bug** Don&#39;t pass the user&#39;s config path as the config_file when creating a
  StyleGuide
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.5.4
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Missed an attribute rename during the v2.5.3 release.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.5.3
   ```

   ### 2.5.1
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Properly look for ``.flake8`` in current working directory
  (`GitLab103`_)

- **Bug** Monkey-patch ``pep8.stdin_get_value`` to cache the actual value in
  stdin. This helps plugins relying on the function when run with
  multiprocessing. (`GitLab105`_, `GitLab107`_)

  setuptools command. (`GitLab39`_, `GitLab!23`_)

- **Bug** Do not verify dependencies of extensions loaded via entry-points.

- **Improvement** Blacklist versions of pep8 we know are broken

.. _GitLab39: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/39
.. _GitLab!23: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/merge_requests/23
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.4.0
   ```
   ------------------

- **Bug** Print filenames when using multiprocessing and ``-q`` option.

  - ``mccabe &lt; 0.4``

  - ``pyflakes &lt; 0.9``

  See also `GitLab32`_

  was run from a git hook. (`GitHub2`_)

- **Improvement** Print warnings for users who are providing mutually
  exclusive options to flake8. (`GitLab8`_, `GitLab!18`_)

- **Feature** Allow git hook configuration to live in ``.git/config``.
  See the updated `VCS hooks docs`_ for more details. (`GitLab!20`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.2.4
   ```
   ------------------

- Fix bugs triggered by turning multiprocessing on by default (again)

  Multiprocessing is forcibly disabled in the following cases:

  - Passing something in via stdin

  - Analyzing a diff

  - Using windows

- Fix --install-hook when there are no config files present for pep8 or
  flake8.

- Fix how the setuptools command parses excludes in config files

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 2.0.0
   ```
   ------------------

- Pyflakes errors are prefixed by an ``F`` instead of an ``E``
- McCabe complexity warnings are prefixed by a ``C`` instead of a ``W``

   ### 0.26.0
   ```
   ======
- Fix multiple entrypoint comparison failure on Python 3 (Issue 148)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.25.0
   ```
   ======
- Add Python 3.5 to tox configuration
- Deterministic (sorted) metadata
- Fix tagging for Python 3.5 compatibility
- Support py2-none-&#39;arch&#39; and py3-none-&#39;arch&#39; tags
- Treat data-only wheels as pure
- Write to temporary file and rename when using wheel install --force
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.24.0
   ```
   ======
- The python tag used for pure-python packages is now .pyN (major version
  only). This change actually occurred in 0.23.0 when the --python-tag
  option was added, but was not explicitly mentioned in the changelog then.
- wininst2wheel and egg2wheel removed. Use &quot;wheel convert [archive]&quot;
  instead.
- Wheel now supports setuptools style conditional requirements via the
  extras_require={} syntax. Separate &#39;extra&#39; names from conditions using
  the : character. Wheel&#39;s own setup.py does this. (The empty-string
  extra is the same as install_requires.) These conditional requirements
  should work the same whether the package is installed by wheel or
  by setup.py.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.23.0
   ```
   ======
- Compatibility tag flags added to the bdist_wheel command
- sdist should include files necessary for tests
- &#39;wheel convert&#39; can now also convert unpacked eggs to wheel
- Rename pydist.json to metadata.json to avoid stepping on the PEP
- The --skip-scripts option has been removed, and not generating scripts is now
  the default. The option was a temporary approach until installers could
  generate scripts themselves. That is now the case with pip 1.5 and later.
  Note that using pip 1.4 to install a wheel without scripts will leave the
  installation without entry-point wrappers. The &quot;wheel install-scripts&quot;
  command can be used to generate the scripts in such cases.
- Thank you contributors
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.22.0
   ```
   ======
- Include entry_points.txt, scripts a.k.a. commands, in experimental
  pydist.json
- Improved test_requires parsing
- Python 2.6 fixes, &quot;wheel version&quot; command courtesy pombredanne
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.21.0
   ```
   ======
- Pregenerated scripts are the default again.
- &quot;setup.py bdist_wheel --skip-scripts&quot; turns them off.
- setuptools is no longer a listed requirement for the &#39;wheel&#39;
  package. It is of course still required in order for bdist_wheel
  to work.
- &quot;python -m wheel&quot; avoids importing pkg_resources until it&#39;s necessary.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.20.0
   ```
   ======
- No longer include console_scripts in wheels. Ordinary scripts (shell files,
  standalone Python files) are included as usual.
- Include new command &quot;python -m wheel install-scripts [distribution
  [distribution ...]]&quot; to install the console_scripts (setuptools-style
  scripts using pkg_resources) for a distribution.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.19.0
   ```
   ======
- pymeta.json becomes pydist.json
   ```

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.16.0
   ```
   ======
- Python 2.6 compatibility bugfix (thanks John McFarlane)
- Non-prerelease version number
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.15.0
   ```
   ======
- Various improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.14.0
   ```
   ======
- Changed the signature format to better comply with the current JWS spec.
  Breaks all existing signatures.
- Include ``wheel unsign`` command to remove RECORD.jws from an archive.
- Put the description in the newly allowed payload section of PKG-INFO
  (METADATA) files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.13.0
   ```
   ======
- Use distutils instead of sysconfig to get installation paths; can install
  headers.
- Improve WheelFile() sort.
- Allow bootstrap installs without any pkg_resources.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.12.0

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   ======
- Preserve attributes on install.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.10.0
   ```
   ======
- Include a copy of pkg_resources. Wheel can now install into a virtualenv
  that does not have distribute (though most packages still require
  pkg_resources to actually work; wheel install distribute)
- Define a new setup.cfg section [wheel]. universal=1 will
  apply the py2.py3-none-any tag for pure python wheels.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.7
   ```
   =====
- Only import dirspec when needed. dirspec is only needed to find the
  configuration for keygen/signing operations.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.6
   ```
   =====
- requires-dist from setup.cfg overwrites any requirements from setup.py
  Care must be taken that the requirements are the same in both cases,
  or just always install from wheel.
- drop dirspec requirement on win32
- improved command line utility, adds &#39;wheel convert [egg or wininst]&#39; to
  convert legacy binary formats to wheel
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.5
   ```
   =====
- Wheel&#39;s own wheel file can be executed by Python, and can install itself:
  ``python wheel-0.9.5-py27-none-any/wheel install ...``
- Use argparse; basic ``wheel install`` command should run with only stdlib
  dependencies.
- Allow requires_dist in setup.cfg&#39;s [metadata] section. In addition to
  dependencies in setup.py, but will only be interpreted when installing
  from wheel, not from sdist. Can be qualified with environment markers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.4
   ```
   =====
- Fix wheel.signatures in sdist
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.3
   ```
   =====
- Integrated digital signatures support without C extensions.
- Integrated &quot;wheel install&quot; command (single package, no dependency
  resolution) including compatibility check.
- Support Python 3.3
- Use Metadata 1.3 (PEP 426)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.2
   ```
   =====
- Automatic signing if WHEEL_TOOL points to the wheel binary
- Even more Python 3 fixes
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9.1
   ```
   =====
- &#39;wheel sign&#39; uses the keys generated by &#39;wheel keygen&#39; (instead of generating
  a new key at random each time)
- Python 2/3 encoding/decoding fixes
- Run tests on Python 2.6 (without signature verification)
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.9
   ```
   ===
- Updated digital signatures scheme
- Python 3 support for digital signatures
- Always verify RECORD hashes on extract
- &quot;wheel&quot; command line tool to sign, verify, unpack wheel files
   ```

   ```
   ===
- none/any draft pep tags update
- improved wininst2wheel script
- doc changes and other improvements
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 0.7
   ```

   ```
   -------

* 1285: Fixed RuntimeError in pkg_resources.parse_requirements

  unordered sequences (sets or dicts).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 37.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 878: Drop support for Python 2.6. Python 2.6 users should
  rely on &#39;setuptools &lt; 37dev&#39;.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.8.0
   ```
   -------

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 1075: Add new ``Description-Content-Type`` metadata field. `See here for
  documentation on how to use this field.
  &lt;https://packaging.python.org/specifications/description-content-type&gt;`_

* 1068: Sort files and directories when building eggs for
  deterministic order.

  distributions (e.g. when using ``setup_requires`` with a conflicting
  transitive dependency, fix 1124).

* 1133: Improved handling of README files extensions and added
  Markdown to the list of searched READMES.

* 1135: Improve performance of pkg_resources import by not invoking
  ``access`` or ``stat`` and using ``os.listdir`` instead.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 1131: Make possible using several files within ``file:`` directive

   ### 36.2.7
   ```
   -------

* fix 1105: Fix handling of requirements with environment
  markers when declared in ``setup.cfg`` (same treatment as
  for 1081).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.6
   ```
   -------

* 462: Don&#39;t assume a directory is an egg by the ``.egg``
  extension alone.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.5
   ```

* 1112, 1091, 1115: Now using Trusty containers in
  Travis for CI and CD.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.4
   ```
   -------

* 1092: ``pkg_resources`` now uses ``inspect.getmro`` to
  resolve classes in method resolution order.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.3
   ```
   -------

* 1102: Restore behavior for empty extras.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.2
   ```
   -------

* 1099: Revert commit a3ec721, restoring intended purpose of
  extras as part of a requirement declaration.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.1
   ```
   -------

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 1081: Environment markers indicated in ``install_requires``
  are now processed and treated as nameless ``extras_require``
  with markers, allowing their metadata in requires.txt to be
  correctly generated.

* 1053: Tagged commits are now released using Travis-CI
  build stages, meaning releases depend on passing tests on
  all supported Python versions (Linux) and not just the latest
  Python version.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Correct ``py31compat.makedirs`` to correctly honor
  ``exist_ok`` parameter.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 1083: Avoid race condition on directory creation in
  ``pkg_resources.ensure_directory``.

* Removed deprecation of and restored support for
  ``upload_docs`` command for sites other than PyPI.
  Only warehouse is dropping support, but services like
  `devpi &lt;http://doc.devpi.net/latest/&gt;`_ continue to
  support docs built by setuptools&#39; plugins. See
  `this comment &lt;https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/devpi/issues/388/support-rtd-model-for-building-uploadingcomment-34292423&gt;`_
  for more context on the motivation for this change.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 1042: Fix import in py27compat module that still
  referenced six directly, rather than through the externs
  module (vendored packages hook).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 36.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 980 and others: Once again, Setuptools vendors all
  of its dependencies. It seems to be the case that in
  the Python ecosystem, all build tools must run without
  any dependencies (build, runtime, or otherwise). At
  such a point that a mechanism exists that allows
  build tools to have dependencies, Setuptools will adopt
  it.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 1015: Fix test failures on Python 3.7.

* 1024: Add workaround for Jython 2581 in monkey module.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 992: Revert change introduced in v34.4.1, now
  considered invalid.

* 1016: Revert change introduced in v35.0.0 per 1014,
  referencing 436. The approach had unintended
  consequences, causing sdist installs to be missing
  files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 35.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 436: In egg_info.manifest_maker, no longer read
  the file list from the manifest file, and instead
  re-build it on each build. In this way, files removed
  from the specification will not linger in the manifest.
  As a result, any files manually added to the manifest
  will be removed on subsequent egg_info invocations.
  No projects should be manually adding files to the
  manifest and should instead use MANIFEST.in or SCM
  file finders to force inclusion of files in the manifest.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.1
   ```
   -------

* 1008: In MSVC support, use always the last version available for Windows SDK and UCRT SDK.

* 1008: In MSVC support, fix &quot;vcruntime140.dll&quot; returned path with Visual Studio 2017.

* 992: In msvc.msvc9_query_vcvarsall, ensure the
  returned dicts have str values and not Unicode for
  compatibility with os.environ.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 995: In MSVC support, add support for &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio 2017&quot; and &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools 2017&quot;.

* 999 via 1007: Extend support for declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file to include the options
  ``python_requires`` and ``py_modules``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.3
   ```
   -------

* 967 (and 997): Explicitly import submodules of
  packaging to account for environments where the imports
  of those submodules is not implied by other behavior.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.2
   ```
   -------

* 993: Fix documentation upload by correcting
  rendering of content-type in _build_multipart
  on Python 3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 988: Trap ``os.unlink`` same as ``os.remove`` in
  ``auto_chmod`` error handler.

* 983: Fixes to invalid escape sequence deprecations on
  Python 3.6.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 941: In the upload command, if the username is blank,
  default to ``getpass.getuser()``.

* 971: Correct distutils findall monkeypatch to match
  appropriate versions (namely Python 3.4.6).
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 966: Add support for reading dist-info metadata and
  thus locating Distributions from zip files.

* 968: Allow &#39;+&#39; and &#39;!&#39; in egg fragments
  so that it can take package names that contain
  PEP 440 conforming version specifiers.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 953: More aggressively employ the compatibility issue
  originally added in 706.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 930: ``build_info`` now accepts two new parameters
  to optimize and customize the building of C libraries.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.3
   ```
   -------

* 947: Loosen restriction on the version of six required,
  restoring compatibility with environments relying on
  six 1.6.0 and later.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.2
   ```
   -------

* 882: Ensure extras are honored when building the
  working set.
* 913: Fix issue in develop if package directory has
  a trailing slash.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 935: Fix glob syntax in graft.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 34.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 581: Instead of vendoring the growing list of
  dependencies that Setuptools requires to function,
  Setuptools now requires these dependencies just like
  any other project. Unlike other projects, however,
  Setuptools cannot rely on ``setup_requires`` to
  demand the dependencies it needs to install because
  its own machinery would be necessary to pull those
  dependencies if not present (a bootstrapping problem).
  As a result, Setuptools no longer supports self upgrade or
  installation in the general case. Instead, users are
  directed to use pip to install and upgrade using the
  ``wheel`` distributions of setuptools.

  Users are welcome to contrive other means to install
  or upgrade Setuptools using other means, such as
  pre-installing the Setuptools dependencies with pip
  or a bespoke bootstrap tool, but such usage is not
  recommended and is not supported.

  As discovered in 940, not all versions of pip will
  successfully install Setuptools from its pre-built
  wheel. If you encounter issues with &quot;No module named
  six&quot; or &quot;No module named packaging&quot;, especially
  following a line &quot;Running setup.py egg_info for package
  setuptools&quot;, then your pip is not new enough.

  There&#39;s an additional issue in pip where setuptools
  is upgraded concurrently with other source packages,
  described in pip 4253. The proposed workaround is to
  always upgrade Setuptools first prior to upgrading
  other packages that would upgrade Setuptools.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 921: Correct issue where certifi fallback not being
  reached on Windows.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.1.0
   ```
   -------

Installation via pip, as indicated in the `Python Packaging
User&#39;s Guide &lt;https://packaging.python.org/installing/&gt;`_,
is the officially-supported mechanism for installing
Setuptools, and this recommendation is now explicit in the
much more concise README.

Other edits and tweaks were made to the documentation. The
codebase is unchanged.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 33.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 619: Removed support for the ``tag_svn_revision``
  distribution option. If Subversion tagging support is
  still desired, consider adding the functionality to
  setuptools_svn in setuptools_svn 2.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.1
   ```
   -------

* 866: Use ``dis.Bytecode`` on Python 3.4 and later in
  ``setuptools.depends``.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 889: Backport proposed fix for disabling interpolation in
  distutils.Distribution.parse_config_files.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 884: Restore support for running the tests under
  `pytest-runner &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner&gt;`_
  by ensuring that PYTHONPATH is honored in tests invoking
  a subprocess.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.3
   ```
   -------

* 706: Add rmtree compatibility shim for environments where
  rmtree fails when passed a unicode string.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.2
   ```
   -------

* 893: Only release sdist in zip format as warehouse now
  disallows releasing two different formats.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.1
   ```
   -------

* 704: More selectively ensure that &#39;rmtree&#39; is not invoked with
  a byte string, enabling it to remove files that are non-ascii,
  even on Python 2.

* 712: In &#39;sandbox.run_setup&#39;, ensure that ``__file__`` is
  always a ``str``, modeling the behavior observed by the
  interpreter when invoking scripts and modules.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.1.0
   ```
   -------

* 891: In &#39;test&#39; command on test failure, raise DistutilsError,
  suppression invocation of subsequent commands.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 32.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 890: Revert 849. ``global-exclude .foo`` will not match all
  ``*.foo`` files any more. Package authors must add an explicit
  wildcard, such as ``global-exclude *.foo``, to match all
  ``.foo`` files. See 886, 849.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.1
   ```
   -------

* 885: Fix regression where &#39;pkg_resources._rebuild_mod_path&#39;
  would fail when a namespace package&#39;s &#39;__path__&#39; was not
  a list with a sort attribute.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 31.0.0
   ```
   -------

* 250: Install &#39;-nspkg.pth&#39; files for packages installed
  with &#39;setup.py develop&#39;. These .pth files allow
  namespace packages installed by pip or develop to
  co-mingle. This change required the removal of the
  change for 805 and pip 1924, introduced in 28.3.0 and implicated
  in 870, but means that namespace packages not in a
  site packages directory will no longer work on Python
  earlier than 3.5, whereas before they would work on
  Python not earlier than 3.3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.4.0
   ```
   -------

* 879: For declarative config:

  - read_configuration() now accepts ignore_option_errors argument. This allows scraping tools to read metadata without a need to download entire packages. E.g. we can gather some stats right from GitHub repos just by downloading setup.cfg.

  - packages find: directive now supports fine tuning from a subsection. The same arguments as for find() are accepted.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.3.0
   ```
   -------

* 394 via 862: Added support for `declarative package
  config in a setup.cfg file
  &lt;https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.htmlconfiguring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files&gt;`_.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.1
   ```
   -------

* 850: In test command, invoke unittest.main with
  indication not to exit the process.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 30.2.0
   ```
   -------

* 854: Bump to vendored Packaging 16.8.
