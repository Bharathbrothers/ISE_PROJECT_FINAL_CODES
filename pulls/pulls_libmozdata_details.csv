2,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/libmozdata/pulls/179,179,Create Dependabot config file,":wave: Dependabot is moving natively into GitHub! This pull request migrates your configuration from Dependabot.com to a config file, using the [new syntax](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates). When you merge this pull request, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!

With this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/libmozdata/network/updates), rather than the [Dependabot dashboard](https://app.dependabot.com/), to monitor your version updates. Dependabot is now configured exclusively using config files.









Your account was configured to allow an unlimited number of open pull requests. This option is no longer supported in the new config file so it has been changed to `99`.


If you've got any questions or feedback for us, please let us know by creating an issue in the [dependabot/dependabot-core](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues) repository.

### Update [coverage](https://pypi.org/project/coverage) from **4.5.3** to **4.5.3**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 4.5.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Now that 4.5 properly separated the ``[run] omit`` and ``[report] omit``
  settings, an old bug has become apparent.  If you specified a package name
  for ``[run] source``, then omit patterns weren&#39;t matched inside that package.
  This bug (`issue 638`_) is now fixed.

- On Python 3.7, reporting about a decorated function with no body other than a
  docstring would crash coverage.py with an IndexError (`issue 640`_).  This is
  now fixed.

- Configurer plugins are now reported in the output of ``--debug=sys``.

.. _issue 638: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/638/run-omit-is-ignored-since-45
.. _issue 640: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/640/indexerror-reporting-on-an-empty-decorated


.. _changes_45:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.5
   ```
   --------------------------

- A new kind of plugin is supported: configurators are invoked at start-up to
  allow more complex configuration than the .coveragerc file can easily do.
  See :ref:`api_plugin` for details.  This solves the complex configuration
  problem described in `issue 563`_.

- The ``fail_under`` option can now be a float.  Note that you must specify the
  ``[report] precision`` configuration option for the fractional part to be
  used.  Thanks to Lars Hupfeldt Nielsen for help with the implementation.
  Fixes `issue 631`_.

- The ``include`` and ``omit`` options can be specified for both the ``[run]``
  and ``[report]`` phases of execution.  4.4.2 introduced some incorrect
  interactions between those phases, where the options for one were confused
  for the other.  This is now corrected, fixing `issue 621`_ and `issue 622`_.
  Thanks to Daniel Hahler for seeing more clearly than I could.

- The ``coverage combine`` command used to always overwrite the data file, even
  when no data had been read from apparently combinable files.  Now, an error
  is raised if we thought there were files to combine, but in fact none of them
  could be used.  Fixes `issue 629`_.

- The ``coverage combine`` command could get confused about path separators
  when combining data collected on Windows with data collected on Linux, as
  described in `issue 618`_.  This is now fixed: the result path always uses
  the path separator specified in the ``[paths]`` result.

- On Windows, the HTML report could fail when source trees are deeply nested,
  due to attempting to create HTML filenames longer than the 250-character
  maximum.  Now filenames will never get much larger than 200 characters,
  fixing `issue 627`_.  Thanks to Alex Sandro for helping with the fix.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4.2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Support for Python 3.7.  In some cases, class and module docstrings are no
  longer counted in statement totals, which could slightly change your total
  results.

- Specifying both ``--source`` and ``--include`` no longer silently ignores the
  include setting, instead it displays a warning. Thanks, LoÃ¯c Dachary.  Closes
  `issue 265`_ and `issue 101`_.

- Fixed a race condition when saving data and multiple threads are tracing
  (`issue 581`_). It could produce a &quot;dictionary changed size during iteration&quot;
  RuntimeError.  I believe this mostly but not entirely fixes the race
  condition.  A true fix would likely be too expensive.  Thanks, Peter Baughman
  for the debugging, and Olivier Grisel for the fix with tests.

- Configuration values which are file paths will now apply tilde-expansion,
  closing `issue 589`_.

- Now secondary config files like tox.ini and setup.cfg can be specified
  explicitly, and prefixed sections like `[coverage:run]` will be read. Fixes
  `issue 588`_.

- Be more flexible about the command name displayed by help, fixing
  `issue 600`_. Thanks, Ben Finney.

.. _changes_441:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- No code changes: just corrected packaging for Python 2.7 Linux wheels.


.. _changes_44:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4
   ```
   --------------------------

- Reports could produce the wrong file names for packages, reporting ``pkg.py``
  instead of the correct ``pkg/__init__.py``.  This is now fixed.  Thanks, Dirk
  Thomas.

- XML reports could produce ``&lt;source&gt;`` and ``&lt;class&gt;`` lines that together
  didn&#39;t specify a valid source file path.  This is now fixed. (`issue 526`_)

- Namespace packages are no longer warned as having no code. (`issue 572`_)

- Code that uses ``sys.settrace(sys.gettrace())`` in a file that wasn&#39;t being
  coverage-measured would prevent correct coverage measurement in following
  code. An example of this was running doctests programmatically. This is now
  fixed. (`issue 575`_)

- Errors printed by the ``coverage`` command now go to stderr instead of
  stdout.

- Running ``coverage xml`` in a directory named with non-ASCII characters would
  fail under Python 2. This is now fixed. (`issue 573`_)

.. _issue 526: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/526/generated-xml-invalid-paths-for-cobertura
.. _issue 572: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/572/no-python-source-warning-for-namespace
.. _issue 573: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/573/cant-generate-xml-report-if-some-source
.. _issue 575: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/575/running-doctest-prevents-complete-coverage
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Some warnings can now be individually disabled.  Warnings that can be
  disabled have a short name appended.  The ``[run] disable_warnings`` setting
  takes a list of these warning names to disable. Closes both `issue 96`_ and
  `issue 355`_.

- The XML report now includes attributes from version 4 of the Cobertura XML
  format, fixing `issue 570`_.

- In previous versions, calling a method that used collected data would prevent
  further collection.  For example, `save()`, `report()`, `html_report()`, and
  others would all stop collection.  An explicit `start()` was needed to get it
  going again.  This is no longer true.  Now you can use the collected data and
  also continue measurement. Both `issue 79`_ and `issue 448`_ described this
  problem, and have been fixed.

- Plugins can now find unexecuted files if they choose, by implementing the
  `find_executable_files` method.  Thanks, Emil Madsen.

- Minimal IronPython support. You should be able to run IronPython programs
  under ``coverage run``, though you will still have to do the reporting phase
  with CPython.

- Coverage.py has long had a special hack to support CPython&#39;s need to measure
  the coverage of the standard library tests. This code was not installed by
  kitted versions of coverage.py.  Now it is.

   ### 4.3.4
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Fixing 2.6 in version 4.3.3 broke other things, because the too-tricky
  exception wasn&#39;t properly derived from Exception, described in `issue 556`_.
  A newb mistake; it hasn&#39;t been a good few days.

   ### 4.3.3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Python 2.6 support was broken due to a testing exception imported for the
  benefit of the coverage.py test suite.  Properly conditionalizing it fixed
  `issue 554`_ so that Python 2.6 works again.

   ### 4.3.2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Using the ``--skip-covered`` option on an HTML report with 100% coverage
  would cause a &quot;No data to report&quot; error, as reported in `issue 549`_. This is
  now fixed; thanks, LoÃ¯c Dachary.

- If-statements can be optimized away during compilation, for example, `if 0:`
  or `if __debug__:`.  Coverage.py had problems properly understanding these
  statements which existed in the source, but not in the compiled bytecode.
  This problem, reported in `issue 522`_, is now fixed.

- If you specified ``--source`` as a directory, then coverage.py would look for
  importable Python files in that directory, and could identify ones that had
  never been executed at all.  But if you specified it as a package name, that
  detection wasn&#39;t performed.  Now it is, closing `issue 426`_. Thanks to LoÃ¯c
  Dachary for the fix.

- If you started and stopped coverage measurement thousands of times in your
  process, you could crash Python with a &quot;Fatal Python error: deallocating
  None&quot; error.  This is now fixed.  Thanks to Alex Groce for the bug report.

- On PyPy, measuring coverage in subprocesses could produce a warning: &quot;Trace
  function changed, measurement is likely wrong: None&quot;.  This was spurious, and
  has been suppressed.

- Previously, coverage.py couldn&#39;t start on Jython, due to that implementation
  missing the multiprocessing module (`issue 551`_). This problem has now been
  fixed. Also, `issue 322`_ about not being able to invoke coverage
  conveniently, seems much better: ``jython -m coverage run myprog.py`` works
  properly.

- Let&#39;s say you ran the HTML report over and over again in the same output
  directory, with ``--skip-covered``. And imagine due to your heroic
  test-writing efforts, a file just achieved the goal of 100% coverage. With
  coverage.py 4.3, the old HTML file with the less-than-100% coverage would be
  left behind.  This file is now properly deleted.

   ### 4.3.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Some environments couldn&#39;t install 4.3, as described in `issue 540`_. This is
  now fixed.

- The check for conflicting ``--source`` and ``--include`` was too simple in a
  few different ways, breaking a few perfectly reasonable use cases, described
  in `issue 541`_.  The check has been reverted while we re-think the fix for
  `issue 265`_.

   ### 4.3
   ```
   --------------------------

Special thanks to **LoÃ¯c Dachary**, who took an extraordinary interest in
coverage.py and contributed a number of improvements in this release.

- Subprocesses that are measured with `automatic subprocess measurement`_ used
  to read in any pre-existing data file.  This meant data would be incorrectly
  carried forward from run to run.  Now those files are not read, so each
  subprocess only writes its own data. Fixes `issue 510`_.

- The ``coverage combine`` command will now fail if there are no data files to
  combine. The combine changes in 4.2 meant that multiple combines could lose
  data, leaving you with an empty .coverage data file. Fixes
  `issue 525`_, `issue 412`_, `issue 516`_, and probably `issue 511`_.

- Coverage.py wouldn&#39;t execute `sys.excepthook`_ when an exception happened in
  your program.  Now it does, thanks to Andrew Hoos.  Closes `issue 535`_.

- Branch coverage fixes:

  - Branch coverage could misunderstand a finally clause on a try block that
    never continued on to the following statement, as described in `issue
    493`_.  This is now fixed. Thanks to Joe Doherty for the report and LoÃ¯c
    Dachary for the fix.

  - A while loop with a constant condition (while True) and a continue
    statement would be mis-analyzed, as described in `issue 496`_. This is now
    fixed, thanks to a bug report by Eli Skeggs and a fix by LoÃ¯c Dachary.

  - While loops with constant conditions that were never executed could result
    in a non-zero coverage report.  Artem Dayneko reported this in `issue
    502`_, and LoÃ¯c Dachary provided the fix.

- The HTML report now supports a ``--skip-covered`` option like the other
  reporting commands.  Thanks, LoÃ¯c Dachary for the implementation, closing
  `issue 433`_.

- Options can now be read from a tox.ini file, if any. Like setup.cfg, sections
  are prefixed with &quot;coverage:&quot;, so ``[run]`` options will be read from the
  ``[coverage:run]`` section of tox.ini. Implements part of `issue 519`_.
  Thanks, Stephen Finucane.

- Specifying both ``--source`` and ``--include`` no longer silently ignores the
  include setting, instead it fails with a message. Thanks, Nathan Land and
  LoÃ¯c Dachary. Closes `issue 265`_.

- The ``Coverage.combine`` method has a new parameter, ``strict=False``, to
  support failing if there are no data files to combine.

- When forking subprocesses, the coverage data files would have the same random
  number appended to the file name. This didn&#39;t cause problems, because the
  file names had the process id also, making collisions (nearly) impossible.
  But it was disconcerting.  This is now fixed.

- The text report now properly sizes headers when skipping some files, fixing
  `issue 524`_. Thanks, Anthony Sottile and LoÃ¯c Dachary.

- Coverage.py can now search .pex files for source, just as it can .zip and
  .egg.  Thanks, Peter Ebden.

- Data files are now about 15% smaller.

- Improvements in the ``[run] debug`` setting:

  - The &quot;dataio&quot; debug setting now also logs when data files are deleted during
    combining or erasing.

  - A new debug option, &quot;multiproc&quot;, for logging the behavior of
    ``concurrency=multiprocessing``.

  - If you used the debug options &quot;config&quot; and &quot;callers&quot; together, you&#39;d get a
    call stack printed for every line in the multi-line config output. This is
    now fixed.

- Fixed an unusual bug involving multiple coding declarations affecting code
  containing code in multi-line strings: `issue 529`_.

- Coverage.py will no longer be misled into thinking that a plain file is a
  package when interpreting ``--source`` options.  Thanks, Cosimo Lupo.

- If you try to run a non-Python file with coverage.py, you will now get a more
  useful error message. `Issue 514`_.

- The default pragma regex changed slightly, but this will only matter to you
  if you are deranged and use mixed-case pragmas.

- Deal properly with non-ASCII file names in an ASCII-only world, `issue 533`_.

- Programs that set Unicode configuration values could cause UnicodeErrors when
  generating HTML reports.  Pytest-cov is one example.  This is now fixed.

- Prevented deprecation warnings from configparser that happened in some
  circumstances, closing `issue 530`_.

- Corrected the name of the jquery.ba-throttle-debounce.js library. Thanks,
  Ben Finney.  Closes `issue 505`_.

- Testing against PyPy 5.6 and PyPy3 5.5.

- Switched to pytest from nose for running the coverage.py tests.

- Renamed AUTHORS.txt to CONTRIBUTORS.txt, since there are other ways to
  contribute than by writing code. Also put the count of contributors into the
  author string in setup.py, though this might be too cute.

   ### 4.2
   ```
   --------------------------

- Since ``concurrency=multiprocessing`` uses subprocesses, options specified on
  the coverage.py command line will not be communicated down to them.  Only
  options in the configuration file will apply to the subprocesses.
  Previously, the options didn&#39;t apply to the subprocesses, but there was no
  indication.  Now it is an error to use ``--concurrency=multiprocessing`` and
  other run-affecting options on the command line.  This prevents
  failures like those reported in `issue 495`_.

- Filtering the HTML report is now faster, thanks to Ville SkyttÃ¤.

.. _issue 495: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/495/branch-and-concurrency-are-conflicting
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.2b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

Work from the PyCon 2016 Sprints!

- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY: the ``coverage combine`` command now ignores an
  existing ``.coverage`` data file.  It used to include that file in its
  combining.  This caused confusing results, and extra tox &quot;clean&quot; steps.  If
  you want the old behavior, use the new ``coverage combine --append`` option.

- The ``concurrency`` option can now take multiple values, to support programs
  using multiprocessing and another library such as eventlet.  This is only
  possible in the configuration file, not from the command line. The
  configuration file is the only way for sub-processes to all run with the same
  options.  Fixes `issue 484`_.  Thanks to Josh Williams for prototyping.

- Using a ``concurrency`` setting of ``multiprocessing`` now implies
  ``--parallel`` so that the main program is measured similarly to the
  sub-processes.

- When using `automatic subprocess measurement`_, running coverage commands
  would create spurious data files.  This is now fixed, thanks to diagnosis and
  testing by Dan Riti.  Closes `issue 492`_.

- A new configuration option, ``report:sort``, controls what column of the
  text report is used to sort the rows.  Thanks to Dan Wandschneider, this
  closes `issue 199`_.

- The HTML report has a more-visible indicator for which column is being
  sorted.  Closes `issue 298`_, thanks to Josh Williams.

- If the HTML report cannot find the source for a file, the message now
  suggests using the ``-i`` flag to allow the report to continue. Closes
  `issue 231`_, thanks, Nathan Land.

- When reports are ignoring errors, there&#39;s now a warning if a file cannot be
  parsed, rather than being silently ignored.  Closes `issue 396`_. Thanks,
  Matthew Boehm.

- A new option for ``coverage debug`` is available: ``coverage debug config``
  shows the current configuration.  Closes `issue 454`_, thanks to Matthew
  Boehm.

- Running coverage as a module (``python -m coverage``) no longer shows the
  program name as ``__main__.py``.  Fixes `issue 478`_.  Thanks, Scott Belden.

- The `test_helpers` module has been moved into a separate pip-installable
  package: `unittest-mixins`_.

   ### 4.1
   ```
   --------------------------

- The internal attribute `Reporter.file_reporters` was removed in 4.1b3.  It
  should have come has no surprise that there were third-party tools out there
  using that attribute.  It has been restored, but with a deprecation warning.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.1b3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- When running your program, execution can jump from an ``except X:`` line to
  some other line when an exception other than ``X`` happens.  This jump is no
  longer considered a branch when measuring branch coverage.

- When measuring branch coverage, ``yield`` statements that were never resumed
  were incorrectly marked as missing, as reported in `issue 440`_.  This is now
  fixed.

- During branch coverage of single-line callables like lambdas and generator
  expressions, coverage.py can now distinguish between them never being called,
  or being called but not completed.  Fixes `issue 90`_, `issue 460`_ and
  `issue 475`_.

- The HTML report now has a map of the file along the rightmost edge of the
  page, giving an overview of where the missed lines are.  Thanks, Dmitry
  Shishov.

- The HTML report now uses different monospaced fonts, favoring Consolas over
  Courier.  Along the way, `issue 472`_ about not properly handling one-space
  indents was fixed.  The index page also has slightly different styling, to
  try to make the clickable detail pages more apparent.

- Missing branches reported with ``coverage report -m`` will now say ``-&gt;exit``
  for missed branches to the exit of a function, rather than a negative number.
  Fixes `issue 469`_.

- ``coverage --help`` and ``coverage --version`` now mention which tracer is
  installed, to help diagnose problems. The docs mention which features need
  the C extension. (`issue 479`_)

- Officially support PyPy 5.1, which required no changes, just updates to the
  docs.

- The `Coverage.report` function had two parameters with non-None defaults,
  which have been changed.  `show_missing` used to default to True, but now
  defaults to None.  If you had been calling `Coverage.report` without
  specifying `show_missing`, you&#39;ll need to explicitly set it to True to keep
  the same behavior.  `skip_covered` used to default to False. It is now None,
  which doesn&#39;t change the behavior.  This fixes `issue 485`_.

- It&#39;s never been possible to pass a namespace module to one of the analysis
  functions, but now at least we raise a more specific error message, rather
  than getting confused. (`issue 456`_)

- The `coverage.process_startup` function now returns the `Coverage` instance
  it creates, as suggested in `issue 481`_.

- Make a small tweak to how we compare threads, to avoid buggy custom
  comparison code in thread classes. (`issue 245`_)

   ### 4.1b2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Problems with the new branch measurement in 4.1 beta 1 were fixed:

  - Class docstrings were considered executable.  Now they no longer are.

  - ``yield from`` and ``await`` were considered returns from functions, since
    they could tranfer control to the caller.  This produced unhelpful &quot;missing
    branch&quot; reports in a number of circumstances.  Now they no longer are
    considered returns.

  - In unusual situations, a missing branch to a negative number was reported.
    This has been fixed, closing `issue 466`_.

- The XML report now produces correct package names for modules found in
  directories specified with ``source=``.  Fixes `issue 465`_.

- ``coverage report`` won&#39;t produce trailing whitespace.

.. _issue 465: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/465/coveragexml-produces-package-names-with-an
.. _issue 466: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/466/impossible-missed-branch-to-a-negative
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.1b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Branch analysis has been rewritten: it used to be based on bytecode, but now
  uses AST analysis.  This has changed a number of things:

  - More code paths are now considered runnable, especially in
    ``try``/``except`` structures.  This may mean that coverage.py will
    identify more code paths as uncovered.  This could either raise or lower
    your overall coverage number.

  - Python 3.5&#39;s ``async`` and ``await`` keywords are properly supported,
    fixing `issue 434`_.

  - Some long-standing branch coverage bugs were fixed:

    - `issue 129`_: functions with only a docstring for a body would
      incorrectly report a missing branch on the ``def`` line.

    - `issue 212`_: code in an ``except`` block could be incorrectly marked as
      a missing branch.

    - `issue 146`_: context managers (``with`` statements) in a loop or ``try``
      block could confuse the branch measurement, reporting incorrect partial
      branches.

    - `issue 422`_: in Python 3.5, an actual partial branch could be marked as
      complete.

- Pragmas to disable coverage measurement can now be used on decorator lines,
  and they will apply to the entire function or class being decorated.  This
  implements the feature requested in `issue 131`_.

- Multiprocessing support is now available on Windows.  Thanks, Rodrigue
  Cloutier.

- Files with two encoding declarations are properly supported, fixing
  `issue 453`_. Thanks, Max Linke.

- Non-ascii characters in regexes in the configuration file worked in 3.7, but
  stopped working in 4.0.  Now they work again, closing `issue 455`_.

- Form-feed characters would prevent accurate determination of the beginning of
  statements in the rest of the file.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 461`_.

   ```
   ----------------------------

- Fixed a mysterious problem that manifested in different ways: sometimes
  hanging the process (`issue 420`_), sometimes making database connections
  fail (`issue 445`_).

- The XML report now has correct ``&lt;source&gt;`` elements when using a
  ``--source=`` option somewhere besides the current directory.  This fixes
  `issue 439`_. Thanks, Arcady Ivanov.

- Fixed an unusual edge case of detecting source encodings, described in
  `issue 443`_.

- Help messages that mention the command to use now properly use the actual
  command name, which might be different than &quot;coverage&quot;.  Thanks to Ben
  Finney, this closes `issue 438`_.

   ----------------------------

- More work on supporting unusually encoded source. Fixed `issue 431`_.

- Files or directories with non-ASCII characters are now handled properly,
  fixing `issue 432`_.

- Setting a trace function with sys.settrace was broken by a change in 4.0.1,
  as reported in `issue 436`_.  This is now fixed.

- Officially support PyPy 4.0, which required no changes, just updates to the
  docs.

   ### 4.0.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- When combining data files, unreadable files will now generate a warning
  instead of failing the command.  This is more in line with the older
  coverage.py v3.7.1 behavior, which silently ignored unreadable files.
  Prompted by `issue 418`_.

- The --skip-covered option would skip reporting on 100% covered files, but
  also skipped them when calculating total coverage.  This was wrong, it should
  only remove lines from the report, not change the final answer.  This is now
  fixed, closing `issue 423`_.

- In 4.0, the data file recorded a summary of the system on which it was run.
  Combined data files would keep all of those summaries.  This could lead to
  enormous data files consisting of mostly repetitive useless information. That
  summary is now gone, fixing `issue 415`_.  If you want summary information,
  get in touch, and we&#39;ll figure out a better way to do it.

- Test suites that mocked os.path.exists would experience strange failures, due
  to coverage.py using their mock inadvertently.  This is now fixed, closing
  `issue 416`_.

- Importing a ``__init__`` module explicitly would lead to an error:
  ``AttributeError: &#39;module&#39; object has no attribute &#39;__path__&#39;``, as reported
  in `issue 410`_.  This is now fixed.

- Code that uses ``sys.settrace(sys.gettrace())`` used to incur a more than 2x
  speed penalty.  Now there&#39;s no penalty at all. Fixes `issue 397`_.

- Pyexpat C code will no longer be recorded as a source file, fixing
  `issue 419`_.

- The source kit now contains all of the files needed to have a complete source
  tree, re-fixing `issue 137`_ and closing `issue 281`_.

   ### 4.0
   ```
   --------------------------
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0b3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Reporting on an unmeasured file would fail with a traceback.  This is now
  fixed, closing `issue 403`_.

- The Jenkins ShiningPanda plugin looks for an obsolete file name to find the
  HTML reports to publish, so it was failing under coverage.py 4.0.  Now we
  create that file if we are running under Jenkins, to keep things working
  smoothly. `issue 404`_.

- Kits used to include tests and docs, but didn&#39;t install them anywhere, or
  provide all of the supporting tools to make them useful.  Kits no longer
  include tests and docs.  If you were using them from the older packages, get
  in touch and help me understand how.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0b2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- 4.0b1 broke ``--append`` creating new data files.  This is now fixed, closing
  `issue 392`_.

- ``py.test --cov`` can write empty data, then touch files due to ``--source``,
  which made coverage.py mistakenly force the data file to record lines instead
  of arcs.  This would lead to a &quot;Can&#39;t combine line data with arc data&quot; error
  message.  This is now fixed, and changed some method names in the
  CoverageData interface.  Fixes `issue 399`_.

- `CoverageData.read_fileobj` and `CoverageData.write_fileobj` replace the
  `.read` and `.write` methods, and are now properly inverses of each other.

- When using ``report --skip-covered``, a message will now be included in the
  report output indicating how many files were skipped, and if all files are
  skipped, coverage.py won&#39;t accidentally scold you for having no data to
  report.  Thanks, Krystian Kichewko.

- A new conversion utility has been added:  ``python -m coverage.pickle2json``
  will convert v3.x pickle data files to v4.x JSON data files.  Thanks,
  Alexander Todorov.  Closes `issue 395`_.

- A new version identifier is available, `coverage.version_info`, a plain tuple
  of values similar to `sys.version_info`_.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Coverage.py is now licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.  See NOTICE.txt for
  details.  Closes `issue 313`_.

- The data storage has been completely revamped.  The data file is now
  JSON-based instead of a pickle, closing `issue 236`_.  The `CoverageData`
  class is now a public supported documented API to the data file.

- A new configuration option, ``[run] note``, lets you set a note that will be
  stored in the `runs` section of the data file.  You can use this to annotate
  the data file with any information you like.

- Unrecognized configuration options will now print an error message and stop
  coverage.py.  This should help prevent configuration mistakes from passing
  silently.  Finishes `issue 386`_.

- In parallel mode, ``coverage erase`` will now delete all of the data files,
  fixing `issue 262`_.

- Coverage.py now accepts a directory name for ``coverage run`` and will run a
  ``__main__.py`` found there, just like Python will.  Fixes `issue 252`_.
  Thanks, Dmitry Trofimov.

- The XML report now includes a ``missing-branches`` attribute.  Thanks, Steve
  Peak.  This is not a part of the Cobertura DTD, so the XML report no longer
  references the DTD.

- Missing branches in the HTML report now have a bit more information in the
  right-hand annotations.  Hopefully this will make their meaning clearer.

- All the reporting functions now behave the same if no data had been
  collected, exiting with a status code of 1.  Fixed ``fail_under`` to be
  applied even when the report is empty.  Thanks, Ionel Cristian MÄrieÈ.

- Plugins are now initialized differently.  Instead of looking for a class
  called ``Plugin``, coverage.py looks for a function called ``coverage_init``.

- A file-tracing plugin can now ask to have built-in Python reporting by
  returning `&quot;python&quot;` from its `file_reporter()` method.

- Code that was executed with `exec` would be mis-attributed to the file that
  called it.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 380`_.

- The ability to use item access on `Coverage.config` (introduced in 4.0a2) has
  been changed to a more explicit `Coverage.get_option` and
  `Coverage.set_option` API.

- The ``Coverage.use_cache`` method is no longer supported.

- The private method ``Coverage._harvest_data`` is now called
  ``Coverage.get_data``, and returns the ``CoverageData`` containing the
  collected data.

- The project is consistently referred to as &quot;coverage.py&quot; throughout the code
  and the documentation, closing `issue 275`_.

- Combining data files with an explicit configuration file was broken in 4.0a6,
  but now works again, closing `issue 385`_.

- ``coverage combine`` now accepts files as well as directories.

- The speed is back to 3.7.1 levels, after having slowed down due to plugin
  support, finishing up `issue 387`_.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0a6
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Python 3.5b2 and PyPy 2.6.0 are supported.

- The original module-level function interface to coverage.py is no longer
  supported.  You must now create a ``coverage.Coverage`` object, and use
  methods on it.

- The ``coverage combine`` command now accepts any number of directories as
  arguments, and will combine all the data files from those directories.  This
  means you don&#39;t have to copy the files to one directory before combining.
  Thanks, Christine Lytwynec.  Finishes `issue 354`_.

- Branch coverage couldn&#39;t properly handle certain extremely long files. This
  is now fixed (`issue 359`_).

- Branch coverage didn&#39;t understand yield statements properly.  Mickie Betz
  persisted in pursuing this despite Ned&#39;s pessimism.  Fixes `issue 308`_ and
  `issue 324`_.

- The COVERAGE_DEBUG environment variable can be used to set the
  ``[run] debug`` configuration option to control what internal operations are
  logged.

- HTML reports were truncated at formfeed characters.  This is now fixed
  (`issue 360`_).  It&#39;s always fun when the problem is due to a `bug in the
  Python standard library &lt;http://bugs.python.org/issue19035&gt;`_.

- Files with incorrect encoding declaration comments are no longer ignored by
  the reporting commands, fixing `issue 351`_.

- HTML reports now include a timestamp in the footer, closing `issue 299`_.
  Thanks, Conrad Ho.

- HTML reports now begrudgingly use double-quotes rather than single quotes,
  because there are &quot;software engineers&quot; out there writing tools that read HTML
  and somehow have no idea that single quotes exist.  Capitulates to the absurd
  `issue 361`_.  Thanks, Jon Chappell.

- The ``coverage annotate`` command now handles non-ASCII characters properly,
  closing `issue 363`_.  Thanks, Leonardo Pistone.

- Drive letters on Windows were not normalized correctly, now they are. Thanks,
  Ionel Cristian MÄrieÈ.

- Plugin support had some bugs fixed, closing `issue 374`_ and `issue 375`_.
  Thanks, Stefan Behnel.

   ### 4.0a5
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Plugin support is now implemented in the C tracer instead of the Python
  tracer. This greatly improves the speed of tracing projects using plugins.

- Coverage.py now always adds the current directory to sys.path, so that
  plugins can import files in the current directory (`issue 358`_).

- If the `config_file` argument to the Coverage constructor is specified as
  &quot;.coveragerc&quot;, it is treated as if it were True.  This means setup.cfg is
  also examined, and a missing file is not considered an error (`issue 357`_).

- Wildly experimental: support for measuring processes started by the
  multiprocessing module.  To use, set ``--concurrency=multiprocessing``,
  either on the command line or in the .coveragerc file (`issue 117`_). Thanks,
  Eduardo Schettino.  Currently, this does not work on Windows.

- A new warning is possible, if a desired file isn&#39;t measured because it was
  imported before coverage.py was started (`issue 353`_).

- The `coverage.process_startup` function now will start coverage measurement
  only once, no matter how many times it is called.  This fixes problems due
  to unusual virtualenv configurations (`issue 340`_).

- Added 3.5.0a1 to the list of supported CPython versions.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0a4
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Plugins can now provide sys_info for debugging output.

- Started plugins documentation.

- Prepared to move the docs to readthedocs.org.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0a3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Reports now use file names with extensions.  Previously, a report would
  describe a/b/c.py as &quot;a/b/c&quot;.  Now it is shown as &quot;a/b/c.py&quot;.  This allows
  for better support of non-Python files, and also fixed `issue 69`_.

- The XML report now reports each directory as a package again.  This was a bad
  regression, I apologize.  This was reported in `issue 235`_, which is now
  fixed.

- A new configuration option for the XML report: ``[xml] package_depth``
  controls which directories are identified as packages in the report.
  Directories deeper than this depth are not reported as packages.
  The default is that all directories are reported as packages.
  Thanks, Lex Berezhny.

- When looking for the source for a frame, check if the file exists. On
  Windows, .pyw files are no longer recorded as .py files. Along the way, this
  fixed `issue 290`_.

- Empty files are now reported as 100% covered in the XML report, not 0%
  covered (`issue 345`_).

- Regexes in the configuration file are now compiled as soon as they are read,
  to provide error messages earlier (`issue 349`_).

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0a2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Officially support PyPy 2.4, and PyPy3 2.4.  Drop support for
  CPython 3.2 and older versions of PyPy.  The code won&#39;t work on CPython 3.2.
  It will probably still work on older versions of PyPy, but I&#39;m not testing
  against them.

- Plugins!

- The original command line switches (`-x` to run a program, etc) are no
  longer supported.

- A new option: `coverage report --skip-covered` will reduce the number of
  files reported by skipping files with 100% coverage.  Thanks, Krystian
  Kichewko.  This means that empty `__init__.py` files will be skipped, since
  they are 100% covered, closing `issue 315`_.

- You can now specify the ``--fail-under`` option in the ``.coveragerc`` file
  as the ``[report] fail_under`` option.  This closes `issue 314`_.

- The ``COVERAGE_OPTIONS`` environment variable is no longer supported.  It was
  a hack for ``--timid`` before configuration files were available.

- The HTML report now has filtering.  Type text into the Filter box on the
  index page, and only modules with that text in the name will be shown.
  Thanks, Danny Allen.

- The textual report and the HTML report used to report partial branches
  differently for no good reason.  Now the text report&#39;s &quot;missing branches&quot;
  column is a &quot;partial branches&quot; column so that both reports show the same
  numbers.  This closes `issue 342`_.

- If you specify a ``--rcfile`` that cannot be read, you will get an error
  message.  Fixes `issue 343`_.

- The ``--debug`` switch can now be used on any command.

- You can now programmatically adjust the configuration of coverage.py by
  setting items on `Coverage.config` after construction.

- A module run with ``-m`` can be used as the argument to ``--source``, fixing
  `issue 328`_.  Thanks, Buck Evan.

- The regex for matching exclusion pragmas has been fixed to allow more kinds
  of whitespace, fixing `issue 334`_.

- Made some PyPy-specific tweaks to improve speed under PyPy.  Thanks, Alex
  Gaynor.

- In some cases, with a source file missing a final newline, coverage.py would
  count statements incorrectly.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 293`_.

- The status.dat file that HTML reports use to avoid re-creating files that
  haven&#39;t changed is now a JSON file instead of a pickle file.  This obviates
  `issue 287`_ and `issue 237`_.

   ### 4.0a1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Python versions supported are now CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4, and
  PyPy 2.2.

- Gevent, eventlet, and greenlet are now supported, closing `issue 149`_.
  The ``concurrency`` setting specifies the concurrency library in use.  Huge
  thanks to Peter Portante for initial implementation, and to Joe Jevnik for
  the final insight that completed the work.

- Options are now also read from a setup.cfg file, if any.  Sections are
  prefixed with &quot;coverage:&quot;, so the ``[run]`` options will be read from the
  ``[coverage:run]`` section of setup.cfg.  Finishes `issue 304`_.

- The ``report -m`` command can now show missing branches when reporting on
  branch coverage.  Thanks, Steve Leonard. Closes `issue 230`_.

- The XML report now contains a &lt;source&gt; element, fixing `issue 94`_.  Thanks
  Stan Hu.

- The class defined in the coverage module is now called ``Coverage`` instead
  of ``coverage``, though the old name still works, for backward compatibility.

- The ``fail-under`` value is now rounded the same as reported results,
  preventing paradoxical results, fixing `issue 284`_.

- The XML report will now create the output directory if need be, fixing
  `issue 285`_.  Thanks, Chris Rose.

- HTML reports no longer raise UnicodeDecodeError if a Python file has
  undecodable characters, fixing `issue 303`_ and `issue 331`_.

- The annotate command will now annotate all files, not just ones relative to
  the current directory, fixing `issue 57`_.

- The coverage module no longer causes deprecation warnings on Python 3.4 by
  importing the imp module, fixing `issue 305`_.

- Encoding declarations in source files are only considered if they are truly
  comments.  Thanks, Anthony Sottile.

.. _changes_371:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.7.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Improved the speed of HTML report generation by about 20%.

- Fixed the mechanism for finding OS-installed static files for the HTML report
  so that it will actually find OS-installed static files.


.. _changes_37:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.7
   ```
   --------------------------

- Added the ``--debug`` switch to ``coverage run``.  It accepts a list of
  options indicating the type of internal activity to log to stderr.

- Improved the branch coverage facility, fixing `issue 92`_ and `issue 175`_.

- Running code with ``coverage run -m`` now behaves more like Python does,
  setting sys.path properly, which fixes `issue 207`_ and `issue 242`_.

- Coverage.py can now run .pyc files directly, closing `issue 264`_.

- Coverage.py properly supports .pyw files, fixing `issue 261`_.

- Omitting files within a tree specified with the ``source`` option would
  cause them to be incorrectly marked as unexecuted, as described in
  `issue 218`_.  This is now fixed.

- When specifying paths to alias together during data combining, you can now
  specify relative paths, fixing `issue 267`_.

- Most file paths can now be specified with username expansion (``~/src``, or
  ``~build/src``, for example), and with environment variable expansion
  (``build/$BUILDNUM/src``).

- Trying to create an XML report with no files to report on, would cause a
  ZeroDivideError, but no longer does, fixing `issue 250`_.

- When running a threaded program under the Python tracer, coverage.py no
  longer issues a spurious warning about the trace function changing: &quot;Trace
  function changed, measurement is likely wrong: None.&quot;  This fixes `issue
  164`_.

- Static files necessary for HTML reports are found in system-installed places,
  to ease OS-level packaging of coverage.py.  Closes `issue 259`_.

- Source files with encoding declarations, but a blank first line, were not
  decoded properly.  Now they are.  Thanks, Roger Hu.

- The source kit now includes the ``__main__.py`` file in the root coverage
  directory, fixing `issue 255`_.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6
   ```
   --------------------------

- Added a page to the docs about troublesome situations, closing `issue 226`_,
  and added some info to the TODO file, closing `issue 227`_.

.. _issue 226: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/226/make-readme-section-to-describe-when
.. _issue 227: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/227/update-todo
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6b3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Beta 2 broke the nose plugin. It&#39;s fixed again, closing `issue 224`_.

.. _issue 224: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/224/36b2-breaks-nosexcover
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6b2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Coverage.py runs on Python 2.3 and 2.4 again. It was broken in 3.6b1.

- The C extension is optionally compiled using a different more widely-used
  technique, taking another stab at fixing `issue 80`_ once and for all.

- Combining data files would create entries for phantom files if used with
  ``source`` and path aliases.  It no longer does.

- ``debug sys`` now shows the configuration file path that was read.

- If an oddly-behaved package claims that code came from an empty-string
  file name, coverage.py no longer associates it with the directory name,
  fixing `issue 221`_.

.. _issue 221: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/221/coveragepy-incompatible-with-pyratemp
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Wildcards in ``include=`` and ``omit=`` arguments were not handled properly
  in reporting functions, though they were when running.  Now they are handled
  uniformly, closing `issue 143`_ and `issue 163`_.  **NOTE**: it is possible
  that your configurations may now be incorrect.  If you use ``include`` or
  ``omit`` during reporting, whether on the command line, through the API, or
  in a configuration file, please check carefully that you were not relying on
  the old broken behavior.

- The **report**, **html**, and **xml** commands now accept a ``--fail-under``
  switch that indicates in the exit status whether the coverage percentage was
  less than a particular value.  Closes `issue 139`_.

- The reporting functions coverage.report(), coverage.html_report(), and
  coverage.xml_report() now all return a float, the total percentage covered
  measurement.

- The HTML report&#39;s title can now be set in the configuration file, with the
  ``--title`` switch on the command line, or via the API.

- Configuration files now support substitution of environment variables, using
  syntax like ``${WORD}``.  Closes `issue 97`_.

- Embarrassingly, the ``[xml] output=`` setting in the .coveragerc file simply
  didn&#39;t work.  Now it does.

- The XML report now consistently uses file names for the file name attribute,
  rather than sometimes using module names.  Fixes `issue 67`_.
  Thanks, Marcus Cobden.

- Coverage percentage metrics are now computed slightly differently under
  branch coverage.  This means that completely unexecuted files will now
  correctly have 0% coverage, fixing `issue 156`_.  This also means that your
  total coverage numbers will generally now be lower if you are measuring
  branch coverage.

- When installing, now in addition to creating a &quot;coverage&quot; command, two new
  aliases are also installed.  A &quot;coverage2&quot; or &quot;coverage3&quot; command will be
  created, depending on whether you are installing in Python 2.x or 3.x.
  A &quot;coverage-X.Y&quot; command will also be created corresponding to your specific
  version of Python.  Closes `issue 111`_.

- The coverage.py installer no longer tries to bootstrap setuptools or
  Distribute.  You must have one of them installed first, as `issue 202`_
  recommended.

- The coverage.py kit now includes docs (closing `issue 137`_) and tests.

- On Windows, files are now reported in their correct case, fixing `issue 89`_
  and `issue 203`_.

- If a file is missing during reporting, the path shown in the error message
  is now correct, rather than an incorrect path in the current directory.
  Fixes `issue 60`_.

- Running an HTML report in Python 3 in the same directory as an old Python 2
  HTML report would fail with a UnicodeDecodeError. This issue (`issue 193`_)
  is now fixed.

- Fixed yet another error trying to parse non-Python files as Python, this
  time an IndentationError, closing `issue 82`_ for the fourth time...

- If `coverage xml` fails because there is no data to report, it used to
  create a zero-length XML file.  Now it doesn&#39;t, fixing `issue 210`_.

- Jython files now work with the ``--source`` option, fixing `issue 100`_.

- Running coverage.py under a debugger is unlikely to work, but it shouldn&#39;t
  fail with &quot;TypeError: &#39;NoneType&#39; object is not iterable&quot;.  Fixes `issue
  201`_.

- On some Linux distributions, when installed with the OS package manager,
  coverage.py would report its own code as part of the results.  Now it won&#39;t,
  fixing `issue 214`_, though this will take some time to be repackaged by the
  operating systems.

- Docstrings for the legacy singleton methods are more helpful.  Thanks Marius
  Gedminas.  Closes `issue 205`_.

- The pydoc tool can now show documentation for the class `coverage.coverage`.
  Closes `issue 206`_.

- Added a page to the docs about contributing to coverage.py, closing
  `issue 171`_.

- When coverage.py ended unsuccessfully, it may have reported odd errors like
  ``&#39;NoneType&#39; object has no attribute &#39;isabs&#39;``.  It no longer does,
  so kiss `issue 153`_ goodbye.

### Update [coverage](https://pypi.org/project/coverage) from **4.5.3** to **4.5.3**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 4.5.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Now that 4.5 properly separated the ``[run] omit`` and ``[report] omit``
  settings, an old bug has become apparent.  If you specified a package name
  for ``[run] source``, then omit patterns weren&#39;t matched inside that package.
  This bug (`issue 638`_) is now fixed.

- On Python 3.7, reporting about a decorated function with no body other than a
  docstring would crash coverage.py with an IndexError (`issue 640`_).  This is
  now fixed.

- Configurer plugins are now reported in the output of ``--debug=sys``.

.. _issue 638: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/638/run-omit-is-ignored-since-45
.. _issue 640: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/640/indexerror-reporting-on-an-empty-decorated


.. _changes_45:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.5
   ```
   --------------------------

- A new kind of plugin is supported: configurators are invoked at start-up to
  allow more complex configuration than the .coveragerc file can easily do.
  See :ref:`api_plugin` for details.  This solves the complex configuration
  problem described in `issue 563`_.

- The ``fail_under`` option can now be a float.  Note that you must specify the
  ``[report] precision`` configuration option for the fractional part to be
  used.  Thanks to Lars Hupfeldt Nielsen for help with the implementation.
  Fixes `issue 631`_.

- The ``include`` and ``omit`` options can be specified for both the ``[run]``
  and ``[report]`` phases of execution.  4.4.2 introduced some incorrect
  interactions between those phases, where the options for one were confused
  for the other.  This is now corrected, fixing `issue 621`_ and `issue 622`_.
  Thanks to Daniel Hahler for seeing more clearly than I could.

- The ``coverage combine`` command used to always overwrite the data file, even
  when no data had been read from apparently combinable files.  Now, an error
  is raised if we thought there were files to combine, but in fact none of them
  could be used.  Fixes `issue 629`_.

- The ``coverage combine`` command could get confused about path separators
  when combining data collected on Windows with data collected on Linux, as
  described in `issue 618`_.  This is now fixed: the result path always uses
  the path separator specified in the ``[paths]`` result.

- On Windows, the HTML report could fail when source trees are deeply nested,
  due to attempting to create HTML filenames longer than the 250-character
  maximum.  Now filenames will never get much larger than 200 characters,
  fixing `issue 627`_.  Thanks to Alex Sandro for helping with the fix.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4.2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Support for Python 3.7.  In some cases, class and module docstrings are no
  longer counted in statement totals, which could slightly change your total
  results.

- Specifying both ``--source`` and ``--include`` no longer silently ignores the
  include setting, instead it displays a warning. Thanks, LoÃ¯c Dachary.  Closes
  `issue 265`_ and `issue 101`_.

- Fixed a race condition when saving data and multiple threads are tracing
  (`issue 581`_). It could produce a &quot;dictionary changed size during iteration&quot;
  RuntimeError.  I believe this mostly but not entirely fixes the race
  condition.  A true fix would likely be too expensive.  Thanks, Peter Baughman
  for the debugging, and Olivier Grisel for the fix with tests.

- Configuration values which are file paths will now apply tilde-expansion,
  closing `issue 589`_.

- Now secondary config files like tox.ini and setup.cfg can be specified
  explicitly, and prefixed sections like `[coverage:run]` will be read. Fixes
  `issue 588`_.

- Be more flexible about the command name displayed by help, fixing
  `issue 600`_. Thanks, Ben Finney.

.. _changes_441:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- No code changes: just corrected packaging for Python 2.7 Linux wheels.


.. _changes_44:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4
   ```
   --------------------------

- Reports could produce the wrong file names for packages, reporting ``pkg.py``
  instead of the correct ``pkg/__init__.py``.  This is now fixed.  Thanks, Dirk
  Thomas.

- XML reports could produce ``&lt;source&gt;`` and ``&lt;class&gt;`` lines that together
  didn&#39;t specify a valid source file path.  This is now fixed. (`issue 526`_)

- Namespace packages are no longer warned as having no code. (`issue 572`_)

- Code that uses ``sys.settrace(sys.gettrace())`` in a file that wasn&#39;t being
  coverage-measured would prevent correct coverage measurement in following
  code. An example of this was running doctests programmatically. This is now
  fixed. (`issue 575`_)

- Errors printed by the ``coverage`` command now go to stderr instead of
  stdout.

- Running ``coverage xml`` in a directory named with non-ASCII characters would
  fail under Python 2. This is now fixed. (`issue 573`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Some warnings can now be individually disabled.  Warnings that can be
  disabled have a short name appended.  The ``[run] disable_warnings`` setting
  takes a list of these warning names to disable. Closes both `issue 96`_ and
  `issue 355`_.

- The XML report now includes attributes from version 4 of the Cobertura XML
  format, fixing `issue 570`_.

- In previous versions, calling a method that used collected data would prevent
  further collection.  For example, `save()`, `report()`, `html_report()`, and
  others would all stop collection.  An explicit `start()` was needed to get it
  going again.  This is no longer true.  Now you can use the collected data and
  also continue measurement. Both `issue 79`_ and `issue 448`_ described this
  problem, and have been fixed.

- Plugins can now find unexecuted files if they choose, by implementing the
  `find_executable_files` method.  Thanks, Emil Madsen.

- Minimal IronPython support. You should be able to run IronPython programs
  under ``coverage run``, though you will still have to do the reporting phase
  with CPython.

- Coverage.py has long had a special hack to support CPython&#39;s need to measure
  the coverage of the standard library tests. This code was not installed by
  kitted versions of coverage.py.  Now it is.

   ### 4.3.4
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Fixing 2.6 in version 4.3.3 broke other things, because the too-tricky
  exception wasn&#39;t properly derived from Exception, described in `issue 556`_.
  A newb mistake; it hasn&#39;t been a good few days.

.. _changes_433:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.3.3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Python 2.6 support was broken due to a testing exception imported for the
  benefit of the coverage.py test suite.  Properly conditionalizing it fixed
  `issue 554`_ so that Python 2.6 works again.

.. _issue 554: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/554/traceback-on-python-26-starting-with-432


.. _changes_432:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.3.2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Using the ``--skip-covered`` option on an HTML report with 100% coverage
  would cause a &quot;No data to report&quot; error, as reported in `issue 549`_. This is
  now fixed; thanks, LoÃ¯c Dachary.

- If-statements can be optimized away during compilation, for example, `if 0:`
  or `if __debug__:`.  Coverage.py had problems properly understanding these
  statements which existed in the source, but not in the compiled bytecode.
  This problem, reported in `issue 522`_, is now fixed.

- If you specified ``--source`` as a directory, then coverage.py would look for
  importable Python files in that directory, and could identify ones that had
  never been executed at all.  But if you specified it as a package name, that
  detection wasn&#39;t performed.  Now it is, closing `issue 426`_. Thanks to LoÃ¯c
  Dachary for the fix.

- If you started and stopped coverage measurement thousands of times in your
  process, you could crash Python with a &quot;Fatal Python error: deallocating
  None&quot; error.  This is now fixed.  Thanks to Alex Groce for the bug report.

- On PyPy, measuring coverage in subprocesses could produce a warning: &quot;Trace
  function changed, measurement is likely wrong: None&quot;.  This was spurious, and
  has been suppressed.

- Previously, coverage.py couldn&#39;t start on Jython, due to that implementation
  missing the multiprocessing module (`issue 551`_). This problem has now been
  fixed. Also, `issue 322`_ about not being able to invoke coverage
  conveniently, seems much better: ``jython -m coverage run myprog.py`` works
  properly.

- Let&#39;s say you ran the HTML report over and over again in the same output
  directory, with ``--skip-covered``. And imagine due to your heroic
  test-writing efforts, a file just achieved the goal of 100% coverage. With
  coverage.py 4.3, the old HTML file with the less-than-100% coverage would be
  left behind.  This file is now properly deleted.

   ### 4.3.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Some environments couldn&#39;t install 4.3, as described in `issue 540`_. This is
  now fixed.

- The check for conflicting ``--source`` and ``--include`` was too simple in a
  few different ways, breaking a few perfectly reasonable use cases, described
  in `issue 541`_.  The check has been reverted while we re-think the fix for
  `issue 265`_.

   ### 4.3
   ```
   --------------------------

Special thanks to **LoÃ¯c Dachary**, who took an extraordinary interest in
coverage.py and contributed a number of improvements in this release.

- Subprocesses that are measured with `automatic subprocess measurement`_ used
  to read in any pre-existing data file.  This meant data would be incorrectly
  carried forward from run to run.  Now those files are not read, so each
  subprocess only writes its own data. Fixes `issue 510`_.

- The ``coverage combine`` command will now fail if there are no data files to
  combine. The combine changes in 4.2 meant that multiple combines could lose
  data, leaving you with an empty .coverage data file. Fixes
  `issue 525`_, `issue 412`_, `issue 516`_, and probably `issue 511`_.

- Coverage.py wouldn&#39;t execute `sys.excepthook`_ when an exception happened in
  your program.  Now it does, thanks to Andrew Hoos.  Closes `issue 535`_.

- Branch coverage fixes:

  - Branch coverage could misunderstand a finally clause on a try block that
    never continued on to the following statement, as described in `issue
    493`_.  This is now fixed. Thanks to Joe Doherty for the report and LoÃ¯c
    Dachary for the fix.

  - A while loop with a constant condition (while True) and a continue
    statement would be mis-analyzed, as described in `issue 496`_. This is now
    fixed, thanks to a bug report by Eli Skeggs and a fix by LoÃ¯c Dachary.

  - While loops with constant conditions that were never executed could result
    in a non-zero coverage report.  Artem Dayneko reported this in `issue
    502`_, and LoÃ¯c Dachary provided the fix.

- The HTML report now supports a ``--skip-covered`` option like the other
  reporting commands.  Thanks, LoÃ¯c Dachary for the implementation, closing
  `issue 433`_.

- Options can now be read from a tox.ini file, if any. Like setup.cfg, sections
  are prefixed with &quot;coverage:&quot;, so ``[run]`` options will be read from the
  ``[coverage:run]`` section of tox.ini. Implements part of `issue 519`_.
  Thanks, Stephen Finucane.

- Specifying both ``--source`` and ``--include`` no longer silently ignores the
  include setting, instead it fails with a message. Thanks, Nathan Land and
  LoÃ¯c Dachary. Closes `issue 265`_.

- The ``Coverage.combine`` method has a new parameter, ``strict=False``, to
  support failing if there are no data files to combine.

- When forking subprocesses, the coverage data files would have the same random
  number appended to the file name. This didn&#39;t cause problems, because the
  file names had the process id also, making collisions (nearly) impossible.
  But it was disconcerting.  This is now fixed.

- The text report now properly sizes headers when skipping some files, fixing
  `issue 524`_. Thanks, Anthony Sottile and LoÃ¯c Dachary.

- Coverage.py can now search .pex files for source, just as it can .zip and
  .egg.  Thanks, Peter Ebden.

- Data files are now about 15% smaller.

- Improvements in the ``[run] debug`` setting:

  - The &quot;dataio&quot; debug setting now also logs when data files are deleted during
    combining or erasing.

  - A new debug option, &quot;multiproc&quot;, for logging the behavior of
    ``concurrency=multiprocessing``.

  - If you used the debug options &quot;config&quot; and &quot;callers&quot; together, you&#39;d get a
    call stack printed for every line in the multi-line config output. This is
    now fixed.

- Fixed an unusual bug involving multiple coding declarations affecting code
  containing code in multi-line strings: `issue 529`_.

- Coverage.py will no longer be misled into thinking that a plain file is a
  package when interpreting ``--source`` options.  Thanks, Cosimo Lupo.

- If you try to run a non-Python file with coverage.py, you will now get a more
  useful error message. `Issue 514`_.

- The default pragma regex changed slightly, but this will only matter to you
  if you are deranged and use mixed-case pragmas.

- Deal properly with non-ASCII file names in an ASCII-only world, `issue 533`_.

- Programs that set Unicode configuration values could cause UnicodeErrors when
  generating HTML reports.  Pytest-cov is one example.  This is now fixed.

- Prevented deprecation warnings from configparser that happened in some
  circumstances, closing `issue 530`_.

- Corrected the name of the jquery.ba-throttle-debounce.js library. Thanks,
  Ben Finney.  Closes `issue 505`_.

- Testing against PyPy 5.6 and PyPy3 5.5.

- Switched to pytest from nose for running the coverage.py tests.

- Renamed AUTHORS.txt to CONTRIBUTORS.txt, since there are other ways to
  contribute than by writing code. Also put the count of contributors into the
  author string in setup.py, though this might be too cute.

   ### 4.2
   ```
   --------------------------

- Since ``concurrency=multiprocessing`` uses subprocesses, options specified on
  the coverage.py command line will not be communicated down to them.  Only
  options in the configuration file will apply to the subprocesses.
  Previously, the options didn&#39;t apply to the subprocesses, but there was no
  indication.  Now it is an error to use ``--concurrency=multiprocessing`` and
  other run-affecting options on the command line.  This prevents
  failures like those reported in `issue 495`_.

- Filtering the HTML report is now faster, thanks to Ville SkyttÃ¤.

.. _issue 495: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/495/branch-and-concurrency-are-conflicting
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.2b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

Work from the PyCon 2016 Sprints!

- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY: the ``coverage combine`` command now ignores an
  existing ``.coverage`` data file.  It used to include that file in its
  combining.  This caused confusing results, and extra tox &quot;clean&quot; steps.  If
  you want the old behavior, use the new ``coverage combine --append`` option.

- The ``concurrency`` option can now take multiple values, to support programs
  using multiprocessing and another library such as eventlet.  This is only
  possible in the configuration file, not from the command line. The
  configuration file is the only way for sub-processes to all run with the same
  options.  Fixes `issue 484`_.  Thanks to Josh Williams for prototyping.

- Using a ``concurrency`` setting of ``multiprocessing`` now implies
  ``--parallel`` so that the main program is measured similarly to the
  sub-processes.

- When using `automatic subprocess measurement`_, running coverage commands
  would create spurious data files.  This is now fixed, thanks to diagnosis and
  testing by Dan Riti.  Closes `issue 492`_.

- A new configuration option, ``report:sort``, controls what column of the
  text report is used to sort the rows.  Thanks to Dan Wandschneider, this
  closes `issue 199`_.

- The HTML report has a more-visible indicator for which column is being
  sorted.  Closes `issue 298`_, thanks to Josh Williams.

- If the HTML report cannot find the source for a file, the message now
  suggests using the ``-i`` flag to allow the report to continue. Closes
  `issue 231`_, thanks, Nathan Land.

- When reports are ignoring errors, there&#39;s now a warning if a file cannot be
  parsed, rather than being silently ignored.  Closes `issue 396`_. Thanks,
  Matthew Boehm.

- A new option for ``coverage debug`` is available: ``coverage debug config``
  shows the current configuration.  Closes `issue 454`_, thanks to Matthew
  Boehm.

- Running coverage as a module (``python -m coverage``) no longer shows the
  program name as ``__main__.py``.  Fixes `issue 478`_.  Thanks, Scott Belden.

- The `test_helpers` module has been moved into a separate pip-installable
  package: `unittest-mixins`_.

   ### 4.1
   ```
   --------------------------

- The internal attribute `Reporter.file_reporters` was removed in 4.1b3.  It
  should have come has no surprise that there were third-party tools out there
  using that attribute.  It has been restored, but with a deprecation warning.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.1b3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- When running your program, execution can jump from an ``except X:`` line to
  some other line when an exception other than ``X`` happens.  This jump is no
  longer considered a branch when measuring branch coverage.

- When measuring branch coverage, ``yield`` statements that were never resumed
  were incorrectly marked as missing, as reported in `issue 440`_.  This is now
  fixed.

- During branch coverage of single-line callables like lambdas and generator
  expressions, coverage.py can now distinguish between them never being called,
  or being called but not completed.  Fixes `issue 90`_, `issue 460`_ and
  `issue 475`_.

- The HTML report now has a map of the file along the rightmost edge of the
  page, giving an overview of where the missed lines are.  Thanks, Dmitry
  Shishov.

- The HTML report now uses different monospaced fonts, favoring Consolas over
  Courier.  Along the way, `issue 472`_ about not properly handling one-space
  indents was fixed.  The index page also has slightly different styling, to
  try to make the clickable detail pages more apparent.

- Missing branches reported with ``coverage report -m`` will now say ``-&gt;exit``
  for missed branches to the exit of a function, rather than a negative number.
  Fixes `issue 469`_.

- ``coverage --help`` and ``coverage --version`` now mention which tracer is
  installed, to help diagnose problems. The docs mention which features need
  the C extension. (`issue 479`_)

- Officially support PyPy 5.1, which required no changes, just updates to the
  docs.

- The `Coverage.report` function had two parameters with non-None defaults,
  which have been changed.  `show_missing` used to default to True, but now
  defaults to None.  If you had been calling `Coverage.report` without
  specifying `show_missing`, you&#39;ll need to explicitly set it to True to keep
  the same behavior.  `skip_covered` used to default to False. It is now None,
  which doesn&#39;t change the behavior.  This fixes `issue 485`_.

- It&#39;s never been possible to pass a namespace module to one of the analysis
  functions, but now at least we raise a more specific error message, rather
  than getting confused. (`issue 456`_)

- The `coverage.process_startup` function now returns the `Coverage` instance
  it creates, as suggested in `issue 481`_.

- Make a small tweak to how we compare threads, to avoid buggy custom
  comparison code in thread classes. (`issue 245`_)

   ### 4.1b2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Problems with the new branch measurement in 4.1 beta 1 were fixed:

  - Class docstrings were considered executable.  Now they no longer are.

  - ``yield from`` and ``await`` were considered returns from functions, since
    they could tranfer control to the caller.  This produced unhelpful &quot;missing
    branch&quot; reports in a number of circumstances.  Now they no longer are
    considered returns.

  - In unusual situations, a missing branch to a negative number was reported.
    This has been fixed, closing `issue 466`_.

- The XML report now produces correct package names for modules found in
  directories specified with ``source=``.  Fixes `issue 465`_.

- ``coverage report`` won&#39;t produce trailing whitespace.

.. _issue 465: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/465/coveragexml-produces-package-names-with-an
.. _issue 466: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/466/impossible-missed-branch-to-a-negative
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.1b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Branch analysis has been rewritten: it used to be based on bytecode, but now
  uses AST analysis.  This has changed a number of things:

  - More code paths are now considered runnable, especially in
    ``try``/``except`` structures.  This may mean that coverage.py will
    identify more code paths as uncovered.  This could either raise or lower
    your overall coverage number.

  - Python 3.5&#39;s ``async`` and ``await`` keywords are properly supported,
    fixing `issue 434`_.

  - Some long-standing branch coverage bugs were fixed:

    - `issue 129`_: functions with only a docstring for a body would
      incorrectly report a missing branch on the ``def`` line.

    - `issue 212`_: code in an ``except`` block could be incorrectly marked as
      a missing branch.

    - `issue 146`_: context managers (``with`` statements) in a loop or ``try``
      block could confuse the branch measurement, reporting incorrect partial
      branches.

    - `issue 422`_: in Python 3.5, an actual partial branch could be marked as
      complete.

- Pragmas to disable coverage measurement can now be used on decorator lines,
  and they will apply to the entire function or class being decorated.  This
  implements the feature requested in `issue 131`_.

- Multiprocessing support is now available on Windows.  Thanks, Rodrigue
  Cloutier.

- Files with two encoding declarations are properly supported, fixing
  `issue 453`_. Thanks, Max Linke.

- Non-ascii characters in regexes in the configuration file worked in 3.7, but
  stopped working in 4.0.  Now they work again, closing `issue 455`_.

- Form-feed characters would prevent accurate determination of the beginning of
  statements in the rest of the file.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 461`_.

   ### 4.0.3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Fixed a mysterious problem that manifested in different ways: sometimes
  hanging the process (`issue 420`_), sometimes making database connections
  fail (`issue 445`_).

- The XML report now has correct ``&lt;source&gt;`` elements when using a
  ``--source=`` option somewhere besides the current directory.  This fixes
  `issue 439`_. Thanks, Arcady Ivanov.

- Fixed an unusual edge case of detecting source encodings, described in
  `issue 443`_.

- Help messages that mention the command to use now properly use the actual
  command name, which might be different than &quot;coverage&quot;.  Thanks to Ben
  Finney, this closes `issue 438`_.

   ```
   ----------------------------

- More work on supporting unusually encoded source. Fixed `issue 431`_.

- Files or directories with non-ASCII characters are now handled properly,
  fixing `issue 432`_.

- Setting a trace function with sys.settrace was broken by a change in 4.0.1,
  as reported in `issue 436`_.  This is now fixed.

- Officially support PyPy 4.0, which required no changes, just updates to the
  docs.

.. _changes_401:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- When combining data files, unreadable files will now generate a warning
  instead of failing the command.  This is more in line with the older
  coverage.py v3.7.1 behavior, which silently ignored unreadable files.
  Prompted by `issue 418`_.

- The --skip-covered option would skip reporting on 100% covered files, but
  also skipped them when calculating total coverage.  This was wrong, it should
  only remove lines from the report, not change the final answer.  This is now
  fixed, closing `issue 423`_.

- In 4.0, the data file recorded a summary of the system on which it was run.
  Combined data files would keep all of those summaries.  This could lead to
  enormous data files consisting of mostly repetitive useless information. That
  summary is now gone, fixing `issue 415`_.  If you want summary information,
  get in touch, and we&#39;ll figure out a better way to do it.

- Test suites that mocked os.path.exists would experience strange failures, due
  to coverage.py using their mock inadvertently.  This is now fixed, closing
  `issue 416`_.

- Importing a ``__init__`` module explicitly would lead to an error:
  ``AttributeError: &#39;module&#39; object has no attribute &#39;__path__&#39;``, as reported
  in `issue 410`_.  This is now fixed.

- Code that uses ``sys.settrace(sys.gettrace())`` used to incur a more than 2x
  speed penalty.  Now there&#39;s no penalty at all. Fixes `issue 397`_.

- Pyexpat C code will no longer be recorded as a source file, fixing
  `issue 419`_.

- The source kit now contains all of the files needed to have a complete source
  tree, re-fixing `issue 137`_ and closing `issue 281`_.

   ### 4.0b3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Reporting on an unmeasured file would fail with a traceback.  This is now
  fixed, closing `issue 403`_.

- The Jenkins ShiningPanda plugin looks for an obsolete file name to find the
  HTML reports to publish, so it was failing under coverage.py 4.0.  Now we
  create that file if we are running under Jenkins, to keep things working
  smoothly. `issue 404`_.

- Kits used to include tests and docs, but didn&#39;t install them anywhere, or
  provide all of the supporting tools to make them useful.  Kits no longer
  include tests and docs.  If you were using them from the older packages, get
  in touch and help me understand how.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0b2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- 4.0b1 broke ``--append`` creating new data files.  This is now fixed, closing
  `issue 392`_.

- ``py.test --cov`` can write empty data, then touch files due to ``--source``,
  which made coverage.py mistakenly force the data file to record lines instead
  of arcs.  This would lead to a &quot;Can&#39;t combine line data with arc data&quot; error
  message.  This is now fixed, and changed some method names in the
  CoverageData interface.  Fixes `issue 399`_.

- `CoverageData.read_fileobj` and `CoverageData.write_fileobj` replace the
  `.read` and `.write` methods, and are now properly inverses of each other.

- When using ``report --skip-covered``, a message will now be included in the
  report output indicating how many files were skipped, and if all files are
  skipped, coverage.py won&#39;t accidentally scold you for having no data to
  report.  Thanks, Krystian Kichewko.

- A new conversion utility has been added:  ``python -m coverage.pickle2json``
  will convert v3.x pickle data files to v4.x JSON data files.  Thanks,
  Alexander Todorov.  Closes `issue 395`_.

- A new version identifier is available, `coverage.version_info`, a plain tuple
  of values similar to `sys.version_info`_.

   ### 4.0b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Coverage.py is now licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.  See NOTICE.txt for
  details.  Closes `issue 313`_.

- The data storage has been completely revamped.  The data file is now
  JSON-based instead of a pickle, closing `issue 236`_.  The `CoverageData`
  class is now a public supported documented API to the data file.

- A new configuration option, ``[run] note``, lets you set a note that will be
  stored in the `runs` section of the data file.  You can use this to annotate
  the data file with any information you like.

- Unrecognized configuration options will now print an error message and stop
  coverage.py.  This should help prevent configuration mistakes from passing
  silently.  Finishes `issue 386`_.

- In parallel mode, ``coverage erase`` will now delete all of the data files,
  fixing `issue 262`_.

- Coverage.py now accepts a directory name for ``coverage run`` and will run a
  ``__main__.py`` found there, just like Python will.  Fixes `issue 252`_.
  Thanks, Dmitry Trofimov.

- The XML report now includes a ``missing-branches`` attribute.  Thanks, Steve
  Peak.  This is not a part of the Cobertura DTD, so the XML report no longer
  references the DTD.

- Missing branches in the HTML report now have a bit more information in the
  right-hand annotations.  Hopefully this will make their meaning clearer.

- All the reporting functions now behave the same if no data had been
  collected, exiting with a status code of 1.  Fixed ``fail_under`` to be
  applied even when the report is empty.  Thanks, Ionel Cristian MÄrieÈ.

- Plugins are now initialized differently.  Instead of looking for a class
  called ``Plugin``, coverage.py looks for a function called ``coverage_init``.

- A file-tracing plugin can now ask to have built-in Python reporting by
  returning `&quot;python&quot;` from its `file_reporter()` method.

- Code that was executed with `exec` would be mis-attributed to the file that
  called it.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 380`_.

- The ability to use item access on `Coverage.config` (introduced in 4.0a2) has
  been changed to a more explicit `Coverage.get_option` and
  `Coverage.set_option` API.

- The ``Coverage.use_cache`` method is no longer supported.

- The private method ``Coverage._harvest_data`` is now called
  ``Coverage.get_data``, and returns the ``CoverageData`` containing the
  collected data.

- The project is consistently referred to as &quot;coverage.py&quot; throughout the code
  and the documentation, closing `issue 275`_.

- Combining data files with an explicit configuration file was broken in 4.0a6,
  but now works again, closing `issue 385`_.

- ``coverage combine`` now accepts files as well as directories.

- The speed is back to 3.7.1 levels, after having slowed down due to plugin
  support, finishing up `issue 387`_.

   ### 4.0a6
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Python 3.5b2 and PyPy 2.6.0 are supported.

- The original module-level function interface to coverage.py is no longer
  supported.  You must now create a ``coverage.Coverage`` object, and use
  methods on it.

- The ``coverage combine`` command now accepts any number of directories as
  arguments, and will combine all the data files from those directories.  This
  means you don&#39;t have to copy the files to one directory before combining.
  Thanks, Christine Lytwynec.  Finishes `issue 354`_.

- Branch coverage couldn&#39;t properly handle certain extremely long files. This
  is now fixed (`issue 359`_).

- Branch coverage didn&#39;t understand yield statements properly.  Mickie Betz
  persisted in pursuing this despite Ned&#39;s pessimism.  Fixes `issue 308`_ and
  `issue 324`_.

- The COVERAGE_DEBUG environment variable can be used to set the
  ``[run] debug`` configuration option to control what internal operations are
  logged.

- HTML reports were truncated at formfeed characters.  This is now fixed
  (`issue 360`_).  It&#39;s always fun when the problem is due to a `bug in the
  Python standard library &lt;http://bugs.python.org/issue19035&gt;`_.

- Files with incorrect encoding declaration comments are no longer ignored by
  the reporting commands, fixing `issue 351`_.

- HTML reports now include a timestamp in the footer, closing `issue 299`_.
  Thanks, Conrad Ho.

- HTML reports now begrudgingly use double-quotes rather than single quotes,
  because there are &quot;software engineers&quot; out there writing tools that read HTML
  and somehow have no idea that single quotes exist.  Capitulates to the absurd
  `issue 361`_.  Thanks, Jon Chappell.

- The ``coverage annotate`` command now handles non-ASCII characters properly,
  closing `issue 363`_.  Thanks, Leonardo Pistone.

- Drive letters on Windows were not normalized correctly, now they are. Thanks,
  Ionel Cristian MÄrieÈ.

- Plugin support had some bugs fixed, closing `issue 374`_ and `issue 375`_.
  Thanks, Stefan Behnel.

   ### 4.0a5
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Plugin support is now implemented in the C tracer instead of the Python
  tracer. This greatly improves the speed of tracing projects using plugins.

- Coverage.py now always adds the current directory to sys.path, so that
  plugins can import files in the current directory (`issue 358`_).

- If the `config_file` argument to the Coverage constructor is specified as
  &quot;.coveragerc&quot;, it is treated as if it were True.  This means setup.cfg is
  also examined, and a missing file is not considered an error (`issue 357`_).

- Wildly experimental: support for measuring processes started by the
  multiprocessing module.  To use, set ``--concurrency=multiprocessing``,
  either on the command line or in the .coveragerc file (`issue 117`_). Thanks,
  Eduardo Schettino.  Currently, this does not work on Windows.

- A new warning is possible, if a desired file isn&#39;t measured because it was
  imported before coverage.py was started (`issue 353`_).

- The `coverage.process_startup` function now will start coverage measurement
  only once, no matter how many times it is called.  This fixes problems due
  to unusual virtualenv configurations (`issue 340`_).

- Added 3.5.0a1 to the list of supported CPython versions.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0a4
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Plugins can now provide sys_info for debugging output.

- Started plugins documentation.

- Prepared to move the docs to readthedocs.org.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0a3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Reports now use file names with extensions.  Previously, a report would
  describe a/b/c.py as &quot;a/b/c&quot;.  Now it is shown as &quot;a/b/c.py&quot;.  This allows
  for better support of non-Python files, and also fixed `issue 69`_.

- The XML report now reports each directory as a package again.  This was a bad
  regression, I apologize.  This was reported in `issue 235`_, which is now
  fixed.

- A new configuration option for the XML report: ``[xml] package_depth``
  controls which directories are identified as packages in the report.
  Directories deeper than this depth are not reported as packages.
  The default is that all directories are reported as packages.
  Thanks, Lex Berezhny.

- When looking for the source for a frame, check if the file exists. On
  Windows, .pyw files are no longer recorded as .py files. Along the way, this
  fixed `issue 290`_.

- Empty files are now reported as 100% covered in the XML report, not 0%
  covered (`issue 345`_).

- Regexes in the configuration file are now compiled as soon as they are read,
  to provide error messages earlier (`issue 349`_).

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0a2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Officially support PyPy 2.4, and PyPy3 2.4.  Drop support for
  CPython 3.2 and older versions of PyPy.  The code won&#39;t work on CPython 3.2.
  It will probably still work on older versions of PyPy, but I&#39;m not testing
  against them.

- Plugins!

- The original command line switches (`-x` to run a program, etc) are no
  longer supported.

- A new option: `coverage report --skip-covered` will reduce the number of
  files reported by skipping files with 100% coverage.  Thanks, Krystian
  Kichewko.  This means that empty `__init__.py` files will be skipped, since
  they are 100% covered, closing `issue 315`_.

- You can now specify the ``--fail-under`` option in the ``.coveragerc`` file
  as the ``[report] fail_under`` option.  This closes `issue 314`_.

- The ``COVERAGE_OPTIONS`` environment variable is no longer supported.  It was
  a hack for ``--timid`` before configuration files were available.

- The HTML report now has filtering.  Type text into the Filter box on the
  index page, and only modules with that text in the name will be shown.
  Thanks, Danny Allen.

- The textual report and the HTML report used to report partial branches
  differently for no good reason.  Now the text report&#39;s &quot;missing branches&quot;
  column is a &quot;partial branches&quot; column so that both reports show the same
  numbers.  This closes `issue 342`_.

- If you specify a ``--rcfile`` that cannot be read, you will get an error
  message.  Fixes `issue 343`_.

- The ``--debug`` switch can now be used on any command.

- You can now programmatically adjust the configuration of coverage.py by
  setting items on `Coverage.config` after construction.

- A module run with ``-m`` can be used as the argument to ``--source``, fixing
  `issue 328`_.  Thanks, Buck Evan.

- The regex for matching exclusion pragmas has been fixed to allow more kinds
  of whitespace, fixing `issue 334`_.

- Made some PyPy-specific tweaks to improve speed under PyPy.  Thanks, Alex
  Gaynor.

- In some cases, with a source file missing a final newline, coverage.py would
  count statements incorrectly.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 293`_.

- The status.dat file that HTML reports use to avoid re-creating files that
  haven&#39;t changed is now a JSON file instead of a pickle file.  This obviates
  `issue 287`_ and `issue 237`_.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0a1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Python versions supported are now CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4, and
  PyPy 2.2.

- Gevent, eventlet, and greenlet are now supported, closing `issue 149`_.
  The ``concurrency`` setting specifies the concurrency library in use.  Huge
  thanks to Peter Portante for initial implementation, and to Joe Jevnik for
  the final insight that completed the work.

- Options are now also read from a setup.cfg file, if any.  Sections are
  prefixed with &quot;coverage:&quot;, so the ``[run]`` options will be read from the
  ``[coverage:run]`` section of setup.cfg.  Finishes `issue 304`_.

- The ``report -m`` command can now show missing branches when reporting on
  branch coverage.  Thanks, Steve Leonard. Closes `issue 230`_.

- The XML report now contains a &lt;source&gt; element, fixing `issue 94`_.  Thanks
  Stan Hu.

- The class defined in the coverage module is now called ``Coverage`` instead
  of ``coverage``, though the old name still works, for backward compatibility.

- The ``fail-under`` value is now rounded the same as reported results,
  preventing paradoxical results, fixing `issue 284`_.

- The XML report will now create the output directory if need be, fixing
  `issue 285`_.  Thanks, Chris Rose.

- HTML reports no longer raise UnicodeDecodeError if a Python file has
  undecodable characters, fixing `issue 303`_ and `issue 331`_.

- The annotate command will now annotate all files, not just ones relative to
  the current directory, fixing `issue 57`_.

- The coverage module no longer causes deprecation warnings on Python 3.4 by
  importing the imp module, fixing `issue 305`_.

- Encoding declarations in source files are only considered if they are truly
  comments.  Thanks, Anthony Sottile.

.. _changes_371:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.7.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Improved the speed of HTML report generation by about 20%.

- Fixed the mechanism for finding OS-installed static files for the HTML report
  so that it will actually find OS-installed static files.


.. _changes_37:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.7
   ```
   --------------------------

- Added the ``--debug`` switch to ``coverage run``.  It accepts a list of
  options indicating the type of internal activity to log to stderr.

- Improved the branch coverage facility, fixing `issue 92`_ and `issue 175`_.

- Running code with ``coverage run -m`` now behaves more like Python does,
  setting sys.path properly, which fixes `issue 207`_ and `issue 242`_.

- Coverage.py can now run .pyc files directly, closing `issue 264`_.

- Coverage.py properly supports .pyw files, fixing `issue 261`_.

- Omitting files within a tree specified with the ``source`` option would
  cause them to be incorrectly marked as unexecuted, as described in
  `issue 218`_.  This is now fixed.

- When specifying paths to alias together during data combining, you can now
  specify relative paths, fixing `issue 267`_.

- Most file paths can now be specified with username expansion (``~/src``, or
  ``~build/src``, for example), and with environment variable expansion
  (``build/$BUILDNUM/src``).

- Trying to create an XML report with no files to report on, would cause a
  ZeroDivideError, but no longer does, fixing `issue 250`_.

- When running a threaded program under the Python tracer, coverage.py no
  longer issues a spurious warning about the trace function changing: &quot;Trace
  function changed, measurement is likely wrong: None.&quot;  This fixes `issue
  164`_.

- Static files necessary for HTML reports are found in system-installed places,
  to ease OS-level packaging of coverage.py.  Closes `issue 259`_.

- Source files with encoding declarations, but a blank first line, were not
  decoded properly.  Now they are.  Thanks, Roger Hu.

- The source kit now includes the ``__main__.py`` file in the root coverage
  directory, fixing `issue 255`_.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6
   ```
   --------------------------

- Added a page to the docs about troublesome situations, closing `issue 226`_,
  and added some info to the TODO file, closing `issue 227`_.

.. _issue 226: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/226/make-readme-section-to-describe-when
.. _issue 227: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/227/update-todo
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6b3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Beta 2 broke the nose plugin. It&#39;s fixed again, closing `issue 224`_.

.. _issue 224: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/224/36b2-breaks-nosexcover
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6b2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Coverage.py runs on Python 2.3 and 2.4 again. It was broken in 3.6b1.

- The C extension is optionally compiled using a different more widely-used
  technique, taking another stab at fixing `issue 80`_ once and for all.

- Combining data files would create entries for phantom files if used with
  ``source`` and path aliases.  It no longer does.

- ``debug sys`` now shows the configuration file path that was read.

- If an oddly-behaved package claims that code came from an empty-string
  file name, coverage.py no longer associates it with the directory name,
  fixing `issue 221`_.

.. _issue 221: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/221/coveragepy-incompatible-with-pyratemp
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Wildcards in ``include=`` and ``omit=`` arguments were not handled properly
  in reporting functions, though they were when running.  Now they are handled
  uniformly, closing `issue 143`_ and `issue 163`_.  **NOTE**: it is possible
  that your configurations may now be incorrect.  If you use ``include`` or
  ``omit`` during reporting, whether on the command line, through the API, or
  in a configuration file, please check carefully that you were not relying on
  the old broken behavior.

- The **report**, **html**, and **xml** commands now accept a ``--fail-under``
  switch that indicates in the exit status whether the coverage percentage was
  less than a particular value.  Closes `issue 139`_.

- The reporting functions coverage.report(), coverage.html_report(), and
  coverage.xml_report() now all return a float, the total percentage covered
  measurement.

- The HTML report&#39;s title can now be set in the configuration file, with the
  ``--title`` switch on the command line, or via the API.

- Configuration files now support substitution of environment variables, using
  syntax like ``${WORD}``.  Closes `issue 97`_.

- Embarrassingly, the ``[xml] output=`` setting in the .coveragerc file simply
  didn&#39;t work.  Now it does.

- The XML report now consistently uses file names for the file name attribute,
  rather than sometimes using module names.  Fixes `issue 67`_.
  Thanks, Marcus Cobden.

- Coverage percentage metrics are now computed slightly differently under
  branch coverage.  This means that completely unexecuted files will now
  correctly have 0% coverage, fixing `issue 156`_.  This also means that your
  total coverage numbers will generally now be lower if you are measuring
  branch coverage.

- When installing, now in addition to creating a &quot;coverage&quot; command, two new
  aliases are also installed.  A &quot;coverage2&quot; or &quot;coverage3&quot; command will be
  created, depending on whether you are installing in Python 2.x or 3.x.
  A &quot;coverage-X.Y&quot; command will also be created corresponding to your specific
  version of Python.  Closes `issue 111`_.

- The coverage.py installer no longer tries to bootstrap setuptools or
  Distribute.  You must have one of them installed first, as `issue 202`_
  recommended.

- The coverage.py kit now includes docs (closing `issue 137`_) and tests.

- On Windows, files are now reported in their correct case, fixing `issue 89`_
  and `issue 203`_.

- If a file is missing during reporting, the path shown in the error message
  is now correct, rather than an incorrect path in the current directory.
  Fixes `issue 60`_.

- Running an HTML report in Python 3 in the same directory as an old Python 2
  HTML report would fail with a UnicodeDecodeError. This issue (`issue 193`_)
  is now fixed.

- Fixed yet another error trying to parse non-Python files as Python, this
  time an IndentationError, closing `issue 82`_ for the fourth time...

- If `coverage xml` fails because there is no data to report, it used to
  create a zero-length XML file.  Now it doesn&#39;t, fixing `issue 210`_.

- Jython files now work with the ``--source`` option, fixing `issue 100`_.

- Running coverage.py under a debugger is unlikely to work, but it shouldn&#39;t
  fail with &quot;TypeError: &#39;NoneType&#39; object is not iterable&quot;.  Fixes `issue
  201`_.

- On some Linux distributions, when installed with the OS package manager,
  coverage.py would report its own code as part of the results.  Now it won&#39;t,
  fixing `issue 214`_, though this will take some time to be repackaged by the
  operating systems.

- Docstrings for the legacy singleton methods are more helpful.  Thanks Marius
  Gedminas.  Closes `issue 205`_.

- The pydoc tool can now show documentation for the class `coverage.coverage`.
  Closes `issue 206`_.

- Added a page to the docs about contributing to coverage.py, closing
  `issue 171`_.

- When coverage.py ended unsuccessfully, it may have reported odd errors like
  ``&#39;NoneType&#39; object has no attribute &#39;isabs&#39;``.  It no longer does,
  so kiss `issue 153`_ goodbye.

### Update [coverage](https://pypi.org/project/coverage) from **4.5.3** to **4.5.3**.


<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 4.5.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Now that 4.5 properly separated the ``[run] omit`` and ``[report] omit``
  settings, an old bug has become apparent.  If you specified a package name
  for ``[run] source``, then omit patterns weren&#39;t matched inside that package.
  This bug (`issue 638`_) is now fixed.

- On Python 3.7, reporting about a decorated function with no body other than a
  docstring would crash coverage.py with an IndexError (`issue 640`_).  This is
  now fixed.

- Configurer plugins are now reported in the output of ``--debug=sys``.

   ### 4.5
   ```
   --------------------------

- A new kind of plugin is supported: configurators are invoked at start-up to
  allow more complex configuration than the .coveragerc file can easily do.
  See :ref:`api_plugin` for details.  This solves the complex configuration
  problem described in `issue 563`_.

- The ``fail_under`` option can now be a float.  Note that you must specify the
  ``[report] precision`` configuration option for the fractional part to be
  used.  Thanks to Lars Hupfeldt Nielsen for help with the implementation.
  Fixes `issue 631`_.

- The ``include`` and ``omit`` options can be specified for both the ``[run]``
  and ``[report]`` phases of execution.  4.4.2 introduced some incorrect
  interactions between those phases, where the options for one were confused
  for the other.  This is now corrected, fixing `issue 621`_ and `issue 622`_.
  Thanks to Daniel Hahler for seeing more clearly than I could.

- The ``coverage combine`` command used to always overwrite the data file, even
  when no data had been read from apparently combinable files.  Now, an error
  is raised if we thought there were files to combine, but in fact none of them
  could be used.  Fixes `issue 629`_.

- The ``coverage combine`` command could get confused about path separators
  when combining data collected on Windows with data collected on Linux, as
  described in `issue 618`_.  This is now fixed: the result path always uses
  the path separator specified in the ``[paths]`` result.

- On Windows, the HTML report could fail when source trees are deeply nested,
  due to attempting to create HTML filenames longer than the 250-character
  maximum.  Now filenames will never get much larger than 200 characters,
  fixing `issue 627`_.  Thanks to Alex Sandro for helping with the fix.

   ### 4.4.2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Support for Python 3.7.  In some cases, class and module docstrings are no
  longer counted in statement totals, which could slightly change your total
  results.

- Specifying both ``--source`` and ``--include`` no longer silently ignores the
  include setting, instead it displays a warning. Thanks, LoÃ¯c Dachary.  Closes
  `issue 265`_ and `issue 101`_.

- Fixed a race condition when saving data and multiple threads are tracing
  (`issue 581`_). It could produce a &quot;dictionary changed size during iteration&quot;
  RuntimeError.  I believe this mostly but not entirely fixes the race
  condition.  A true fix would likely be too expensive.  Thanks, Peter Baughman
  for the debugging, and Olivier Grisel for the fix with tests.

- Configuration values which are file paths will now apply tilde-expansion,
  closing `issue 589`_.

- Now secondary config files like tox.ini and setup.cfg can be specified
  explicitly, and prefixed sections like `[coverage:run]` will be read. Fixes
  `issue 588`_.

- Be more flexible about the command name displayed by help, fixing
  `issue 600`_. Thanks, Ben Finney.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- No code changes: just corrected packaging for Python 2.7 Linux wheels.


.. _changes_44:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4
   ```
   --------------------------

- Reports could produce the wrong file names for packages, reporting ``pkg.py``
  instead of the correct ``pkg/__init__.py``.  This is now fixed.  Thanks, Dirk
  Thomas.

- XML reports could produce ``&lt;source&gt;`` and ``&lt;class&gt;`` lines that together
  didn&#39;t specify a valid source file path.  This is now fixed. (`issue 526`_)

- Namespace packages are no longer warned as having no code. (`issue 572`_)

- Code that uses ``sys.settrace(sys.gettrace())`` in a file that wasn&#39;t being
  coverage-measured would prevent correct coverage measurement in following
  code. An example of this was running doctests programmatically. This is now
  fixed. (`issue 575`_)

- Errors printed by the ``coverage`` command now go to stderr instead of
  stdout.

- Running ``coverage xml`` in a directory named with non-ASCII characters would
  fail under Python 2. This is now fixed. (`issue 573`_)

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.4b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Some warnings can now be individually disabled.  Warnings that can be
  disabled have a short name appended.  The ``[run] disable_warnings`` setting
  takes a list of these warning names to disable. Closes both `issue 96`_ and
  `issue 355`_.

- The XML report now includes attributes from version 4 of the Cobertura XML
  format, fixing `issue 570`_.

- In previous versions, calling a method that used collected data would prevent
  further collection.  For example, `save()`, `report()`, `html_report()`, and
  others would all stop collection.  An explicit `start()` was needed to get it
  going again.  This is no longer true.  Now you can use the collected data and
  also continue measurement. Both `issue 79`_ and `issue 448`_ described this
  problem, and have been fixed.

- Plugins can now find unexecuted files if they choose, by implementing the
  `find_executable_files` method.  Thanks, Emil Madsen.

- Minimal IronPython support. You should be able to run IronPython programs
  under ``coverage run``, though you will still have to do the reporting phase
  with CPython.

- Coverage.py has long had a special hack to support CPython&#39;s need to measure
  the coverage of the standard library tests. This code was not installed by
  kitted versions of coverage.py.  Now it is.

   ### 4.3.4
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Fixing 2.6 in version 4.3.3 broke other things, because the too-tricky
  exception wasn&#39;t properly derived from Exception, described in `issue 556`_.
  A newb mistake; it hasn&#39;t been a good few days.

.. _changes_433:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.3.3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Python 2.6 support was broken due to a testing exception imported for the
  benefit of the coverage.py test suite.  Properly conditionalizing it fixed
  `issue 554`_ so that Python 2.6 works again.

.. _issue 554: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/554/traceback-on-python-26-starting-with-432


.. _changes_432:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.3.2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Using the ``--skip-covered`` option on an HTML report with 100% coverage
  would cause a &quot;No data to report&quot; error, as reported in `issue 549`_. This is
  now fixed; thanks, LoÃ¯c Dachary.

- If-statements can be optimized away during compilation, for example, `if 0:`
  or `if __debug__:`.  Coverage.py had problems properly understanding these
  statements which existed in the source, but not in the compiled bytecode.
  This problem, reported in `issue 522`_, is now fixed.

- If you specified ``--source`` as a directory, then coverage.py would look for
  importable Python files in that directory, and could identify ones that had
  never been executed at all.  But if you specified it as a package name, that
  detection wasn&#39;t performed.  Now it is, closing `issue 426`_. Thanks to LoÃ¯c
  Dachary for the fix.

- If you started and stopped coverage measurement thousands of times in your
  process, you could crash Python with a &quot;Fatal Python error: deallocating
  None&quot; error.  This is now fixed.  Thanks to Alex Groce for the bug report.

- On PyPy, measuring coverage in subprocesses could produce a warning: &quot;Trace
  function changed, measurement is likely wrong: None&quot;.  This was spurious, and
  has been suppressed.

- Previously, coverage.py couldn&#39;t start on Jython, due to that implementation
  missing the multiprocessing module (`issue 551`_). This problem has now been
  fixed. Also, `issue 322`_ about not being able to invoke coverage
  conveniently, seems much better: ``jython -m coverage run myprog.py`` works
  properly.

- Let&#39;s say you ran the HTML report over and over again in the same output
  directory, with ``--skip-covered``. And imagine due to your heroic
  test-writing efforts, a file just achieved the goal of 100% coverage. With
  coverage.py 4.3, the old HTML file with the less-than-100% coverage would be
  left behind.  This file is now properly deleted.

   ### 4.3.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Some environments couldn&#39;t install 4.3, as described in `issue 540`_. This is
  now fixed.

- The check for conflicting ``--source`` and ``--include`` was too simple in a
  few different ways, breaking a few perfectly reasonable use cases, described
  in `issue 541`_.  The check has been reverted while we re-think the fix for
  `issue 265`_.

   ### 4.3
   ```
   --------------------------

Special thanks to **LoÃ¯c Dachary**, who took an extraordinary interest in
coverage.py and contributed a number of improvements in this release.

- Subprocesses that are measured with `automatic subprocess measurement`_ used
  to read in any pre-existing data file.  This meant data would be incorrectly
  carried forward from run to run.  Now those files are not read, so each
  subprocess only writes its own data. Fixes `issue 510`_.

- The ``coverage combine`` command will now fail if there are no data files to
  combine. The combine changes in 4.2 meant that multiple combines could lose
  data, leaving you with an empty .coverage data file. Fixes
  `issue 525`_, `issue 412`_, `issue 516`_, and probably `issue 511`_.

- Coverage.py wouldn&#39;t execute `sys.excepthook`_ when an exception happened in
  your program.  Now it does, thanks to Andrew Hoos.  Closes `issue 535`_.

- Branch coverage fixes:

  - Branch coverage could misunderstand a finally clause on a try block that
    never continued on to the following statement, as described in `issue
    493`_.  This is now fixed. Thanks to Joe Doherty for the report and LoÃ¯c
    Dachary for the fix.

  - A while loop with a constant condition (while True) and a continue
    statement would be mis-analyzed, as described in `issue 496`_. This is now
    fixed, thanks to a bug report by Eli Skeggs and a fix by LoÃ¯c Dachary.

  - While loops with constant conditions that were never executed could result
    in a non-zero coverage report.  Artem Dayneko reported this in `issue
    502`_, and LoÃ¯c Dachary provided the fix.

- The HTML report now supports a ``--skip-covered`` option like the other
  reporting commands.  Thanks, LoÃ¯c Dachary for the implementation, closing
  `issue 433`_.

- Options can now be read from a tox.ini file, if any. Like setup.cfg, sections
  are prefixed with &quot;coverage:&quot;, so ``[run]`` options will be read from the
  ``[coverage:run]`` section of tox.ini. Implements part of `issue 519`_.
  Thanks, Stephen Finucane.

- Specifying both ``--source`` and ``--include`` no longer silently ignores the
  include setting, instead it fails with a message. Thanks, Nathan Land and
  LoÃ¯c Dachary. Closes `issue 265`_.

- The ``Coverage.combine`` method has a new parameter, ``strict=False``, to
  support failing if there are no data files to combine.

- When forking subprocesses, the coverage data files would have the same random
  number appended to the file name. This didn&#39;t cause problems, because the
  file names had the process id also, making collisions (nearly) impossible.
  But it was disconcerting.  This is now fixed.

- The text report now properly sizes headers when skipping some files, fixing
  `issue 524`_. Thanks, Anthony Sottile and LoÃ¯c Dachary.

- Coverage.py can now search .pex files for source, just as it can .zip and
  .egg.  Thanks, Peter Ebden.

- Data files are now about 15% smaller.

- Improvements in the ``[run] debug`` setting:

  - The &quot;dataio&quot; debug setting now also logs when data files are deleted during
    combining or erasing.

  - A new debug option, &quot;multiproc&quot;, for logging the behavior of
    ``concurrency=multiprocessing``.

  - If you used the debug options &quot;config&quot; and &quot;callers&quot; together, you&#39;d get a
    call stack printed for every line in the multi-line config output. This is
    now fixed.

- Fixed an unusual bug involving multiple coding declarations affecting code
  containing code in multi-line strings: `issue 529`_.

- Coverage.py will no longer be misled into thinking that a plain file is a
  package when interpreting ``--source`` options.  Thanks, Cosimo Lupo.

- If you try to run a non-Python file with coverage.py, you will now get a more
  useful error message. `Issue 514`_.

- The default pragma regex changed slightly, but this will only matter to you
  if you are deranged and use mixed-case pragmas.

- Deal properly with non-ASCII file names in an ASCII-only world, `issue 533`_.

- Programs that set Unicode configuration values could cause UnicodeErrors when
  generating HTML reports.  Pytest-cov is one example.  This is now fixed.

- Prevented deprecation warnings from configparser that happened in some
  circumstances, closing `issue 530`_.

- Corrected the name of the jquery.ba-throttle-debounce.js library. Thanks,
  Ben Finney.  Closes `issue 505`_.

- Testing against PyPy 5.6 and PyPy3 5.5.

- Switched to pytest from nose for running the coverage.py tests.

- Renamed AUTHORS.txt to CONTRIBUTORS.txt, since there are other ways to
  contribute than by writing code. Also put the count of contributors into the
  author string in setup.py, though this might be too cute.

   ### 4.2
   ```
   --------------------------

- Since ``concurrency=multiprocessing`` uses subprocesses, options specified on
  the coverage.py command line will not be communicated down to them.  Only
  options in the configuration file will apply to the subprocesses.
  Previously, the options didn&#39;t apply to the subprocesses, but there was no
  indication.  Now it is an error to use ``--concurrency=multiprocessing`` and
  other run-affecting options on the command line.  This prevents
  failures like those reported in `issue 495`_.

- Filtering the HTML report is now faster, thanks to Ville SkyttÃ¤.

.. _issue 495: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/495/branch-and-concurrency-are-conflicting
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.2b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

Work from the PyCon 2016 Sprints!

- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY: the ``coverage combine`` command now ignores an
  existing ``.coverage`` data file.  It used to include that file in its
  combining.  This caused confusing results, and extra tox &quot;clean&quot; steps.  If
  you want the old behavior, use the new ``coverage combine --append`` option.

- The ``concurrency`` option can now take multiple values, to support programs
  using multiprocessing and another library such as eventlet.  This is only
  possible in the configuration file, not from the command line. The
  configuration file is the only way for sub-processes to all run with the same
  options.  Fixes `issue 484`_.  Thanks to Josh Williams for prototyping.

- Using a ``concurrency`` setting of ``multiprocessing`` now implies
  ``--parallel`` so that the main program is measured similarly to the
  sub-processes.

- When using `automatic subprocess measurement`_, running coverage commands
  would create spurious data files.  This is now fixed, thanks to diagnosis and
  testing by Dan Riti.  Closes `issue 492`_.

- A new configuration option, ``report:sort``, controls what column of the
  text report is used to sort the rows.  Thanks to Dan Wandschneider, this
  closes `issue 199`_.

- The HTML report has a more-visible indicator for which column is being
  sorted.  Closes `issue 298`_, thanks to Josh Williams.

- If the HTML report cannot find the source for a file, the message now
  suggests using the ``-i`` flag to allow the report to continue. Closes
  `issue 231`_, thanks, Nathan Land.

- When reports are ignoring errors, there&#39;s now a warning if a file cannot be
  parsed, rather than being silently ignored.  Closes `issue 396`_. Thanks,
  Matthew Boehm.

- A new option for ``coverage debug`` is available: ``coverage debug config``
  shows the current configuration.  Closes `issue 454`_, thanks to Matthew
  Boehm.

- Running coverage as a module (``python -m coverage``) no longer shows the
  program name as ``__main__.py``.  Fixes `issue 478`_.  Thanks, Scott Belden.

- The `test_helpers` module has been moved into a separate pip-installable
  package: `unittest-mixins`_.

   ### 4.1
   ```
   --------------------------

- The internal attribute `Reporter.file_reporters` was removed in 4.1b3.  It
  should have come has no surprise that there were third-party tools out there
  using that attribute.  It has been restored, but with a deprecation warning.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.1b3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- When running your program, execution can jump from an ``except X:`` line to
  some other line when an exception other than ``X`` happens.  This jump is no
  longer considered a branch when measuring branch coverage.

- When measuring branch coverage, ``yield`` statements that were never resumed
  were incorrectly marked as missing, as reported in `issue 440`_.  This is now
  fixed.

- During branch coverage of single-line callables like lambdas and generator
  expressions, coverage.py can now distinguish between them never being called,
  or being called but not completed.  Fixes `issue 90`_, `issue 460`_ and
  `issue 475`_.

- The HTML report now has a map of the file along the rightmost edge of the
  page, giving an overview of where the missed lines are.  Thanks, Dmitry
  Shishov.

- The HTML report now uses different monospaced fonts, favoring Consolas over
  Courier.  Along the way, `issue 472`_ about not properly handling one-space
  indents was fixed.  The index page also has slightly different styling, to
  try to make the clickable detail pages more apparent.

- Missing branches reported with ``coverage report -m`` will now say ``-&gt;exit``
  for missed branches to the exit of a function, rather than a negative number.
  Fixes `issue 469`_.

- ``coverage --help`` and ``coverage --version`` now mention which tracer is
  installed, to help diagnose problems. The docs mention which features need
  the C extension. (`issue 479`_)

- Officially support PyPy 5.1, which required no changes, just updates to the
  docs.

- The `Coverage.report` function had two parameters with non-None defaults,
  which have been changed.  `show_missing` used to default to True, but now
  defaults to None.  If you had been calling `Coverage.report` without
  specifying `show_missing`, you&#39;ll need to explicitly set it to True to keep
  the same behavior.  `skip_covered` used to default to False. It is now None,
  which doesn&#39;t change the behavior.  This fixes `issue 485`_.

- It&#39;s never been possible to pass a namespace module to one of the analysis
  functions, but now at least we raise a more specific error message, rather
  than getting confused. (`issue 456`_)

- The `coverage.process_startup` function now returns the `Coverage` instance
  it creates, as suggested in `issue 481`_.

- Make a small tweak to how we compare threads, to avoid buggy custom
  comparison code in thread classes. (`issue 245`_)

   ### 4.1b2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Problems with the new branch measurement in 4.1 beta 1 were fixed:

  - Class docstrings were considered executable.  Now they no longer are.

  - ``yield from`` and ``await`` were considered returns from functions, since
    they could tranfer control to the caller.  This produced unhelpful &quot;missing
    branch&quot; reports in a number of circumstances.  Now they no longer are
    considered returns.

  - In unusual situations, a missing branch to a negative number was reported.
    This has been fixed, closing `issue 466`_.

- The XML report now produces correct package names for modules found in
  directories specified with ``source=``.  Fixes `issue 465`_.

- ``coverage report`` won&#39;t produce trailing whitespace.

.. _issue 465: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/465/coveragexml-produces-package-names-with-an
.. _issue 466: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/466/impossible-missed-branch-to-a-negative
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.1b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Branch analysis has been rewritten: it used to be based on bytecode, but now
  uses AST analysis.  This has changed a number of things:

  - More code paths are now considered runnable, especially in
    ``try``/``except`` structures.  This may mean that coverage.py will
    identify more code paths as uncovered.  This could either raise or lower
    your overall coverage number.

  - Python 3.5&#39;s ``async`` and ``await`` keywords are properly supported,
    fixing `issue 434`_.

  - Some long-standing branch coverage bugs were fixed:

    - `issue 129`_: functions with only a docstring for a body would
      incorrectly report a missing branch on the ``def`` line.

    - `issue 212`_: code in an ``except`` block could be incorrectly marked as
      a missing branch.

    - `issue 146`_: context managers (``with`` statements) in a loop or ``try``
      block could confuse the branch measurement, reporting incorrect partial
      branches.

    - `issue 422`_: in Python 3.5, an actual partial branch could be marked as
      complete.

- Pragmas to disable coverage measurement can now be used on decorator lines,
  and they will apply to the entire function or class being decorated.  This
  implements the feature requested in `issue 131`_.

- Multiprocessing support is now available on Windows.  Thanks, Rodrigue
  Cloutier.

- Files with two encoding declarations are properly supported, fixing
  `issue 453`_. Thanks, Max Linke.

- Non-ascii characters in regexes in the configuration file worked in 3.7, but
  stopped working in 4.0.  Now they work again, closing `issue 455`_.

- Form-feed characters would prevent accurate determination of the beginning of
  statements in the rest of the file.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 461`_.

   ### 4.0.3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Fixed a mysterious problem that manifested in different ways: sometimes
  hanging the process (`issue 420`_), sometimes making database connections
  fail (`issue 445`_).

- The XML report now has correct ``&lt;source&gt;`` elements when using a
  ``--source=`` option somewhere besides the current directory.  This fixes
  `issue 439`_. Thanks, Arcady Ivanov.

- Fixed an unusual edge case of detecting source encodings, described in
  `issue 443`_.

- Help messages that mention the command to use now properly use the actual
  command name, which might be different than &quot;coverage&quot;.  Thanks to Ben
  Finney, this closes `issue 438`_.

   ### 4.0.2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- More work on supporting unusually encoded source. Fixed `issue 431`_.

- Files or directories with non-ASCII characters are now handled properly,
  fixing `issue 432`_.

- Setting a trace function with sys.settrace was broken by a change in 4.0.1,
  as reported in `issue 436`_.  This is now fixed.

- Officially support PyPy 4.0, which required no changes, just updates to the
  docs.

.. _changes_401:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- When combining data files, unreadable files will now generate a warning
  instead of failing the command.  This is more in line with the older
  coverage.py v3.7.1 behavior, which silently ignored unreadable files.
  Prompted by `issue 418`_.

- The --skip-covered option would skip reporting on 100% covered files, but
  also skipped them when calculating total coverage.  This was wrong, it should
  only remove lines from the report, not change the final answer.  This is now
  fixed, closing `issue 423`_.

- In 4.0, the data file recorded a summary of the system on which it was run.
  Combined data files would keep all of those summaries.  This could lead to
  enormous data files consisting of mostly repetitive useless information. That
  summary is now gone, fixing `issue 415`_.  If you want summary information,
  get in touch, and we&#39;ll figure out a better way to do it.

- Test suites that mocked os.path.exists would experience strange failures, due
  to coverage.py using their mock inadvertently.  This is now fixed, closing
  `issue 416`_.

- Importing a ``__init__`` module explicitly would lead to an error:
  ``AttributeError: &#39;module&#39; object has no attribute &#39;__path__&#39;``, as reported
  in `issue 410`_.  This is now fixed.

- Code that uses ``sys.settrace(sys.gettrace())`` used to incur a more than 2x
  speed penalty.  Now there&#39;s no penalty at all. Fixes `issue 397`_.

- Pyexpat C code will no longer be recorded as a source file, fixing
  `issue 419`_.

- The source kit now contains all of the files needed to have a complete source
  tree, re-fixing `issue 137`_ and closing `issue 281`_.

   ### 4.0
   ```
   --------------------------
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0b3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Reporting on an unmeasured file would fail with a traceback.  This is now
  fixed, closing `issue 403`_.

- The Jenkins ShiningPanda plugin looks for an obsolete file name to find the
  HTML reports to publish, so it was failing under coverage.py 4.0.  Now we
  create that file if we are running under Jenkins, to keep things working
  smoothly. `issue 404`_.

- Kits used to include tests and docs, but didn&#39;t install them anywhere, or
  provide all of the supporting tools to make them useful.  Kits no longer
  include tests and docs.  If you were using them from the older packages, get
  in touch and help me understand how.

   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0b2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- 4.0b1 broke ``--append`` creating new data files.  This is now fixed, closing
  `issue 392`_.

- ``py.test --cov`` can write empty data, then touch files due to ``--source``,
  which made coverage.py mistakenly force the data file to record lines instead
  of arcs.  This would lead to a &quot;Can&#39;t combine line data with arc data&quot; error
  message.  This is now fixed, and changed some method names in the
  CoverageData interface.  Fixes `issue 399`_.

- `CoverageData.read_fileobj` and `CoverageData.write_fileobj` replace the
  `.read` and `.write` methods, and are now properly inverses of each other.

- When using ``report --skip-covered``, a message will now be included in the
  report output indicating how many files were skipped, and if all files are
  skipped, coverage.py won&#39;t accidentally scold you for having no data to
  report.  Thanks, Krystian Kichewko.

- A new conversion utility has been added:  ``python -m coverage.pickle2json``
  will convert v3.x pickle data files to v4.x JSON data files.  Thanks,
  Alexander Todorov.  Closes `issue 395`_.

- A new version identifier is available, `coverage.version_info`, a plain tuple
  of values similar to `sys.version_info`_.

   ### 4.0b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Coverage.py is now licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.  See NOTICE.txt for
  details.  Closes `issue 313`_.

- The data storage has been completely revamped.  The data file is now
  JSON-based instead of a pickle, closing `issue 236`_.  The `CoverageData`
  class is now a public supported documented API to the data file.

- A new configuration option, ``[run] note``, lets you set a note that will be
  stored in the `runs` section of the data file.  You can use this to annotate
  the data file with any information you like.

- Unrecognized configuration options will now print an error message and stop
  coverage.py.  This should help prevent configuration mistakes from passing
  silently.  Finishes `issue 386`_.

- In parallel mode, ``coverage erase`` will now delete all of the data files,
  fixing `issue 262`_.

- Coverage.py now accepts a directory name for ``coverage run`` and will run a
  ``__main__.py`` found there, just like Python will.  Fixes `issue 252`_.
  Thanks, Dmitry Trofimov.

- The XML report now includes a ``missing-branches`` attribute.  Thanks, Steve
  Peak.  This is not a part of the Cobertura DTD, so the XML report no longer
  references the DTD.

- Missing branches in the HTML report now have a bit more information in the
  right-hand annotations.  Hopefully this will make their meaning clearer.

- All the reporting functions now behave the same if no data had been
  collected, exiting with a status code of 1.  Fixed ``fail_under`` to be
  applied even when the report is empty.  Thanks, Ionel Cristian MÄrieÈ.

- Plugins are now initialized differently.  Instead of looking for a class
  called ``Plugin``, coverage.py looks for a function called ``coverage_init``.

- A file-tracing plugin can now ask to have built-in Python reporting by
  returning `&quot;python&quot;` from its `file_reporter()` method.

- Code that was executed with `exec` would be mis-attributed to the file that
  called it.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 380`_.

- The ability to use item access on `Coverage.config` (introduced in 4.0a2) has
  been changed to a more explicit `Coverage.get_option` and
  `Coverage.set_option` API.

- The ``Coverage.use_cache`` method is no longer supported.

- The private method ``Coverage._harvest_data`` is now called
  ``Coverage.get_data``, and returns the ``CoverageData`` containing the
  collected data.

- The project is consistently referred to as &quot;coverage.py&quot; throughout the code
  and the documentation, closing `issue 275`_.

- Combining data files with an explicit configuration file was broken in 4.0a6,
  but now works again, closing `issue 385`_.

- ``coverage combine`` now accepts files as well as directories.

- The speed is back to 3.7.1 levels, after having slowed down due to plugin
  support, finishing up `issue 387`_.

   ### 4.0a6
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Python 3.5b2 and PyPy 2.6.0 are supported.

- The original module-level function interface to coverage.py is no longer
  supported.  You must now create a ``coverage.Coverage`` object, and use
  methods on it.

- The ``coverage combine`` command now accepts any number of directories as
  arguments, and will combine all the data files from those directories.  This
  means you don&#39;t have to copy the files to one directory before combining.
  Thanks, Christine Lytwynec.  Finishes `issue 354`_.

- Branch coverage couldn&#39;t properly handle certain extremely long files. This
  is now fixed (`issue 359`_).

- Branch coverage didn&#39;t understand yield statements properly.  Mickie Betz
  persisted in pursuing this despite Ned&#39;s pessimism.  Fixes `issue 308`_ and
  `issue 324`_.

- The COVERAGE_DEBUG environment variable can be used to set the
  ``[run] debug`` configuration option to control what internal operations are
  logged.

- HTML reports were truncated at formfeed characters.  This is now fixed
  (`issue 360`_).  It&#39;s always fun when the problem is due to a `bug in the
  Python standard library &lt;http://bugs.python.org/issue19035&gt;`_.

- Files with incorrect encoding declaration comments are no longer ignored by
  the reporting commands, fixing `issue 351`_.

- HTML reports now include a timestamp in the footer, closing `issue 299`_.
  Thanks, Conrad Ho.

- HTML reports now begrudgingly use double-quotes rather than single quotes,
  because there are &quot;software engineers&quot; out there writing tools that read HTML
  and somehow have no idea that single quotes exist.  Capitulates to the absurd
  `issue 361`_.  Thanks, Jon Chappell.

- The ``coverage annotate`` command now handles non-ASCII characters properly,
  closing `issue 363`_.  Thanks, Leonardo Pistone.

- Drive letters on Windows were not normalized correctly, now they are. Thanks,
  Ionel Cristian MÄrieÈ.

- Plugin support had some bugs fixed, closing `issue 374`_ and `issue 375`_.
  Thanks, Stefan Behnel.

   ### 4.0a5
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Plugin support is now implemented in the C tracer instead of the Python
  tracer. This greatly improves the speed of tracing projects using plugins.

- Coverage.py now always adds the current directory to sys.path, so that
  plugins can import files in the current directory (`issue 358`_).

- If the `config_file` argument to the Coverage constructor is specified as
  &quot;.coveragerc&quot;, it is treated as if it were True.  This means setup.cfg is
  also examined, and a missing file is not considered an error (`issue 357`_).

- Wildly experimental: support for measuring processes started by the
  multiprocessing module.  To use, set ``--concurrency=multiprocessing``,
  either on the command line or in the .coveragerc file (`issue 117`_). Thanks,
  Eduardo Schettino.  Currently, this does not work on Windows.

- A new warning is possible, if a desired file isn&#39;t measured because it was
  imported before coverage.py was started (`issue 353`_).

- The `coverage.process_startup` function now will start coverage measurement
  only once, no matter how many times it is called.  This fixes problems due
  to unusual virtualenv configurations (`issue 340`_).

- Added 3.5.0a1 to the list of supported CPython versions.

   ### 4.0a4
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Plugins can now provide sys_info for debugging output.

- Started plugins documentation.

- Prepared to move the docs to readthedocs.org.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 4.0a3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Reports now use file names with extensions.  Previously, a report would
  describe a/b/c.py as &quot;a/b/c&quot;.  Now it is shown as &quot;a/b/c.py&quot;.  This allows
  for better support of non-Python files, and also fixed `issue 69`_.

- The XML report now reports each directory as a package again.  This was a bad
  regression, I apologize.  This was reported in `issue 235`_, which is now
  fixed.

- A new configuration option for the XML report: ``[xml] package_depth``
  controls which directories are identified as packages in the report.
  Directories deeper than this depth are not reported as packages.
  The default is that all directories are reported as packages.
  Thanks, Lex Berezhny.

- When looking for the source for a frame, check if the file exists. On
  Windows, .pyw files are no longer recorded as .py files. Along the way, this
  fixed `issue 290`_.

- Empty files are now reported as 100% covered in the XML report, not 0%
  covered (`issue 345`_).

- Regexes in the configuration file are now compiled as soon as they are read,
  to provide error messages earlier (`issue 349`_).

   ### 4.0a2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Officially support PyPy 2.4, and PyPy3 2.4.  Drop support for
  CPython 3.2 and older versions of PyPy.  The code won&#39;t work on CPython 3.2.
  It will probably still work on older versions of PyPy, but I&#39;m not testing
  against them.

- Plugins!

- The original command line switches (`-x` to run a program, etc) are no
  longer supported.

- A new option: `coverage report --skip-covered` will reduce the number of
  files reported by skipping files with 100% coverage.  Thanks, Krystian
  Kichewko.  This means that empty `__init__.py` files will be skipped, since
  they are 100% covered, closing `issue 315`_.

- You can now specify the ``--fail-under`` option in the ``.coveragerc`` file
  as the ``[report] fail_under`` option.  This closes `issue 314`_.

- The ``COVERAGE_OPTIONS`` environment variable is no longer supported.  It was
  a hack for ``--timid`` before configuration files were available.

- The HTML report now has filtering.  Type text into the Filter box on the
  index page, and only modules with that text in the name will be shown.
  Thanks, Danny Allen.

- The textual report and the HTML report used to report partial branches
  differently for no good reason.  Now the text report&#39;s &quot;missing branches&quot;
  column is a &quot;partial branches&quot; column so that both reports show the same
  numbers.  This closes `issue 342`_.

- If you specify a ``--rcfile`` that cannot be read, you will get an error
  message.  Fixes `issue 343`_.

- The ``--debug`` switch can now be used on any command.

- You can now programmatically adjust the configuration of coverage.py by
  setting items on `Coverage.config` after construction.

- A module run with ``-m`` can be used as the argument to ``--source``, fixing
  `issue 328`_.  Thanks, Buck Evan.

- The regex for matching exclusion pragmas has been fixed to allow more kinds
  of whitespace, fixing `issue 334`_.

- Made some PyPy-specific tweaks to improve speed under PyPy.  Thanks, Alex
  Gaynor.

- In some cases, with a source file missing a final newline, coverage.py would
  count statements incorrectly.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 293`_.

- The status.dat file that HTML reports use to avoid re-creating files that
  haven&#39;t changed is now a JSON file instead of a pickle file.  This obviates
  `issue 287`_ and `issue 237`_.

   ### 4.0a1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Python versions supported are now CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4, and
  PyPy 2.2.

- Gevent, eventlet, and greenlet are now supported, closing `issue 149`_.
  The ``concurrency`` setting specifies the concurrency library in use.  Huge
  thanks to Peter Portante for initial implementation, and to Joe Jevnik for
  the final insight that completed the work.

- Options are now also read from a setup.cfg file, if any.  Sections are
  prefixed with &quot;coverage:&quot;, so the ``[run]`` options will be read from the
  ``[coverage:run]`` section of setup.cfg.  Finishes `issue 304`_.

- The ``report -m`` command can now show missing branches when reporting on
  branch coverage.  Thanks, Steve Leonard. Closes `issue 230`_.

- The XML report now contains a &lt;source&gt; element, fixing `issue 94`_.  Thanks
  Stan Hu.

- The class defined in the coverage module is now called ``Coverage`` instead
  of ``coverage``, though the old name still works, for backward compatibility.

- The ``fail-under`` value is now rounded the same as reported results,
  preventing paradoxical results, fixing `issue 284`_.

- The XML report will now create the output directory if need be, fixing
  `issue 285`_.  Thanks, Chris Rose.

- HTML reports no longer raise UnicodeDecodeError if a Python file has
  undecodable characters, fixing `issue 303`_ and `issue 331`_.

- The annotate command will now annotate all files, not just ones relative to
  the current directory, fixing `issue 57`_.

- The coverage module no longer causes deprecation warnings on Python 3.4 by
  importing the imp module, fixing `issue 305`_.

- Encoding declarations in source files are only considered if they are truly
  comments.  Thanks, Anthony Sottile.

.. _changes_371:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.7.1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Improved the speed of HTML report generation by about 20%.

- Fixed the mechanism for finding OS-installed static files for the HTML report
  so that it will actually find OS-installed static files.


.. _changes_37:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.7
   ```
   --------------------------

- Added the ``--debug`` switch to ``coverage run``.  It accepts a list of
  options indicating the type of internal activity to log to stderr.

- Improved the branch coverage facility, fixing `issue 92`_ and `issue 175`_.

- Running code with ``coverage run -m`` now behaves more like Python does,
  setting sys.path properly, which fixes `issue 207`_ and `issue 242`_.

- Coverage.py can now run .pyc files directly, closing `issue 264`_.

- Coverage.py properly supports .pyw files, fixing `issue 261`_.

- Omitting files within a tree specified with the ``source`` option would
  cause them to be incorrectly marked as unexecuted, as described in
  `issue 218`_.  This is now fixed.

- When specifying paths to alias together during data combining, you can now
  specify relative paths, fixing `issue 267`_.

- Most file paths can now be specified with username expansion (``~/src``, or
  ``~build/src``, for example), and with environment variable expansion
  (``build/$BUILDNUM/src``).

- Trying to create an XML report with no files to report on, would cause a
  ZeroDivideError, but no longer does, fixing `issue 250`_.

- When running a threaded program under the Python tracer, coverage.py no
  longer issues a spurious warning about the trace function changing: &quot;Trace
  function changed, measurement is likely wrong: None.&quot;  This fixes `issue
  164`_.

- Static files necessary for HTML reports are found in system-installed places,
  to ease OS-level packaging of coverage.py.  Closes `issue 259`_.

- Source files with encoding declarations, but a blank first line, were not
  decoded properly.  Now they are.  Thanks, Roger Hu.

- The source kit now includes the ``__main__.py`` file in the root coverage
  directory, fixing `issue 255`_.

.. _changes_36:
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6
   ```
   --------------------------

- Added a page to the docs about troublesome situations, closing `issue 226`_,
  and added some info to the TODO file, closing `issue 227`_.

.. _issue 226: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/226/make-readme-section-to-describe-when
.. _issue 227: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/227/update-todo
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6b3
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Beta 2 broke the nose plugin. It&#39;s fixed again, closing `issue 224`_.

.. _issue 224: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/224/36b2-breaks-nosexcover
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6b2
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Coverage.py runs on Python 2.3 and 2.4 again. It was broken in 3.6b1.

- The C extension is optionally compiled using a different more widely-used
  technique, taking another stab at fixing `issue 80`_ once and for all.

- Combining data files would create entries for phantom files if used with
  ``source`` and path aliases.  It no longer does.

- ``debug sys`` now shows the configuration file path that was read.

- If an oddly-behaved package claims that code came from an empty-string
  file name, coverage.py no longer associates it with the directory name,
  fixing `issue 221`_.

.. _issue 221: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/221/coveragepy-incompatible-with-pyratemp
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6b1
   ```
   ----------------------------

- Wildcards in ``include=`` and ``omit=`` arguments were not handled properly
  in reporting functions, though they were when running.  Now they are handled
  uniformly, closing `issue 143`_ and `issue 163`_.  **NOTE**: it is possible
  that your configurations may now be incorrect.  If you use ``include`` or
  ``omit`` during reporting, whether on the command line, through the API, or
  in a configuration file, please check carefully that you were not relying on
  the old broken behavior.

- The **report**, **html**, and **xml** commands now accept a ``--fail-under``
  switch that indicates in the exit status whether the coverage percentage was
  less than a particular value.  Closes `issue 139`_.

- The reporting functions coverage.report(), coverage.html_report(), and
  coverage.xml_report() now all return a float, the total percentage covered
  measurement.

- The HTML report&#39;s title can now be set in the configuration file, with the
  ``--title`` switch on the command line, or via the API.

- Configuration files now support substitution of environment variables, using
  syntax like ``${WORD}``.  Closes `issue 97`_.

- Embarrassingly, the ``[xml] output=`` setting in the .coveragerc file simply
  didn&#39;t work.  Now it does.

- The XML report now consistently uses file names for the file name attribute,
  rather than sometimes using module names.  Fixes `issue 67`_.
  Thanks, Marcus Cobden.

- Coverage percentage metrics are now computed slightly differently under
  branch coverage.  This means that completely unexecuted files will now
  correctly have 0% coverage, fixing `issue 156`_.  This also means that your
  total coverage numbers will generally now be lower if you are measuring
  branch coverage.

- When installing, now in addition to creating a &quot;coverage&quot; command, two new
  aliases are also installed.  A &quot;coverage2&quot; or &quot;coverage3&quot; command will be
  created, depending on whether you are installing in Python 2.x or 3.x.
  A &quot;coverage-X.Y&quot; command will also be created corresponding to your specific
  version of Python.  Closes `issue 111`_.

- The coverage.py installer no longer tries to bootstrap setuptools or
  Distribute.  You must have one of them installed first, as `issue 202`_
  recommended.

- The coverage.py kit now includes docs (closing `issue 137`_) and tests.

- On Windows, files are now reported in their correct case, fixing `issue 89`_
  and `issue 203`_.

- If a file is missing during reporting, the path shown in the error message
  is now correct, rather than an incorrect path in the current directory.
  Fixes `issue 60`_.

- Running an HTML report in Python 3 in the same directory as an old Python 2
  HTML report would fail with a UnicodeDecodeError. This issue (`issue 193`_)
  is now fixed.

- Fixed yet another error trying to parse non-Python files as Python, this
  time an IndentationError, closing `issue 82`_ for the fourth time...

- If `coverage xml` fails because there is no data to report, it used to
  create a zero-length XML file.  Now it doesn&#39;t, fixing `issue 210`_.

- Jython files now work with the ``--source`` option, fixing `issue 100`_.

- Running coverage.py under a debugger is unlikely to work, but it shouldn&#39;t
  fail with &quot;TypeError: &#39;NoneType&#39; object is not iterable&quot;.  Fixes `issue
  201`_.

- On some Linux distributions, when installed with the OS package manager,
  coverage.py would report its own code as part of the results.  Now it won&#39;t,
  fixing `issue 214`_, though this will take some time to be repackaged by the
  operating systems.

- Docstrings for the legacy singleton methods are more helpful.  Thanks Marius
  Gedminas.  Closes `issue 205`_.

- The pydoc tool can now show documentation for the class `coverage.coverage`.
  Closes `issue 206`_.

- Added a page to the docs about contributing to coverage.py, closing
  `issue 171`_.

- When coverage.py ended unsuccessfully, it may have reported odd errors like
  ``&#39;NoneType&#39; object has no attribute &#39;isabs&#39;``.  It no longer does,
  so kiss `issue 153`_ goodbye.

As both these tools (pypi2nix & libmozdata) will be used a lot in the next releng/relman projects, it's a bit problematic...

When i looked up the scipy usage in libmozdata, i noticed only one function is used ATM, maybe it could be replaced by an implementation using numpy ?

For now i used the archive from my own libmozdata fork to update the shipit project. It works fine, but would be cleaner if you applied these changes upstream.
