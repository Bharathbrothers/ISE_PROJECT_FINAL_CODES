1,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fx-crash-sig/pulls/33,33,Fix symbolication issues (#32),"This is a big set of changes.

It looks like the structure of crash pings have changed over the last few years. This updates the code to handle the current version. Plus it changes the code to work with the whole crash ping rather than pieces of it. It specifies which pieces it needs in the comments.

This gets rid of the ""windows flag"" in favor of looking at the `normalized_os` field of the crash ping.

This creates a `SYMBOLICATION_API` constant and moves it to the top level.

This fixes `fx-crash-sig` and `sample.json` so those work. This also updates the examples in `README.md`.

Finally, it fixes the issue where the output of symbolication puts the debug_file (e.g. xul.pdb) in the module field of frames. Signature generation expects that field to be the filename (e.g. xul.dll). I claim that's a bug in the symbolication API code, but until it's fixed there, we have to fix it in fx-crash-sig.",willkg,820826,2021-03-18T23:16:37Z,MEMBER,True,1122,1018,8,Get Firefox crash signature from raw crash trace,Python,77459a451dc5d724a412849fed53e7b71495d31d,"Fix symbolication issues (#32)

36,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fx-crash-sig/pulls/11,11,WIP: First draft of integrating this with BigQuery,"This is a first attempt-- not sure if this is the right approach. But basically:

* Set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service/account/file.json (the service account should be one on the `fx-crash-sig-bigquery-project`)
* Run `python bigquery-etl.py 2020-05-20 > out.csv` (this will take a while) 
* Insert CSV into BigQuery using the [bq command-line tool](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/cookbooks/bigquery/access.html#from-bq-command-line-tool): `bq load test.crash_signature out.csv document_id:string,crash_signature:string`

Then from the BigQuery console in the `fx-crash-sig-bigquery-project`, you should be able to
do things like:

```sql
SELECT
  crash.application.build_id,
  crash_signature.crash_signature
FROM
  test.crash_signature
INNER JOIN
  `moz-fx-data-shared-prod`.telemetry.crash
ON
  crash.document_id = crash_signature.document_id
  AND DATE(submission_timestamp) = '2020-05-20';
```

And you'll get a map of build ids to (credible looking?) crash signatures. Note
this will only work after some point in mid-May, due to some schema issues (we can
backfill fixes at some point in the future if needed)

Still todo:
- [ ] Validate these crash signatures are remotely valid, fix any problems in fx-crash-sig
- [ ] Figure out if @willkg's symbolic might be useful here (he mentioned it when he found out I was working on this): https://bluesock.org/~willkg/blog/mozilla/experimenting_with_symbolic.html
