We can't wait for it to be hidden as it is initially hidden, so we'd continue too soon. We can't reliably wait for it to be visible (and then hidden) because it's often displayed for such a short amount of time that we might miss it due to latency. This has only become an issue in Firefox since Selenium 2.48, which brought the behaviour closer to a real user, and we're effectively clicking the loading message instead of the submit button. The best fix would be for Persona to give us some indication that the loading screen has been displayed but is no longer displayed. For now, I'm going to add a sleep of 5 seconds, which should be plenty of time for the loading screen to appear, if not also disappear. For this, I can only apologise!

60,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bidpom/pulls/73,73,Make bidpom pip installable,"These changes allow us to install bidpom using pip from a branch/tag in the bidpom repository. Sorry for the size of the pull request but really all that's happening here is:
1. Change the structure of the repo so the package files are in a subfolder called `browserid`.
2. Because of the structural changes, change the tests to find the packages that they import (e.g., `BrowserID`, `pages.sign_in`, etc.).
3. Create a `setup.py` file that allows the package to be installed.

The tests for bidpom pass [1], and I also did a test with Moztrap-tests [2] and it passes with the new structure, and using a pip installable package instead of a submodule. I didn't have to change any of the code for Moztrap-tests, but I did have to change the `requirements.txt` file and also I removed the git submodule [3].

Please review this pull request and provide your feedback. I believe that we can merge this if we like, and still keep all of the sites using the submodule for now, as they will all be pointing to an older commit. We can then convert each of the sites to use the package in a similar way to what was done in [3].

We could either point the projects that use this to the master branch, or, as @davehunt suggested, we could use a tag.

I could have created a page object for the 123done.org home page, but I didn't want to mix that (which is only needed for the tests) with the actual bidpom page objects, which are used by other suites. I could have put the page object somewhere else, e.g., /tests/pages, but it seemed simpler to just put the locators into tests/base.py.

Feedback is welcomed.

Not really keen on using the environment for this, but for now...

This is mostly a strawman pull request. If there better ways you'd like to fix this, then just punt on this PR and do that. In particular as I say above I don't like the use of environment here, but unless I'm reading this wrong, bidpom has no access to the mozwebqa object, so using conftest.py in e.g., BrowserID-Tests/myfavoritebeer to add a command-line option is out.

Just FYI, the browserid workflow is that there is no 'master' branch. Instead it's called dev. Every two weeks, a branch is cut from dev called 'train-YYYY.mm.dd' and that goes first into stage (e.g., beta.myfavoritebeer.org and diresworb.org) for final testing and localization time, and then that branch moves to production (e.g., myfavoritebeer.org and browserid.org) after two weeks.
