88,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/measure-noise/pulls/13,13,Add example methodology for cleaning bimodal data.,"No need to merge this, I thought I'd make a PR for discussion though.

It will be difficult to quantify the noise when the data is bi-modal since there may be multiple noise profiles that can conflict with each other. This example script finds the multi-modal peaks, extracts them, performs a baseline correction, and then integrates the modes into one time series to obtain a single noise profile (they could also be analyzed separately).

Here are some sample figures from before and after the operations.

1. Corrected versus uncorrected data:
