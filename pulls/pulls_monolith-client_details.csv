> **Bugfixes**
> 
> -   Content-Type header parsing is now case-insensitive (e.g.

> -   Fixed exception leak where certain redirect urls would raise
>     uncaught urllib3 exceptions.
> -   Requests removes Authorization header from requests redirected
>     from https to http on the same hostname. (CVE-2018-18074)
> -   `should_bypass_proxies` now handles URIs without hostnames (e.g.
>     files).
> 
> **Dependencies**
> 
> - Requests now supports urllib3 v1.24.
> 
> **Deprecations**
> 
> - Requests has officially stopped support for Python 2.6.
>

> -------------------
> 
> **Bugfixes**

> -   Fixed issue where status\_codes.py's `init` function failed trying
>     to append to a `__doc__` value of `None`.
> 
> 2.19.0 (2018-06-12)
> -------------------
> 
> **Improvements**
> 
> -   Warn user about possible slowdown when using cryptography version
>     &lt; 1.3.4
> -   Check for invalid host in proxy URL, before forwarding request to
>     adapter.
> -   Fragments are now properly maintained across redirects. (RFC7231
>     7.1.2)
> -   Removed use of cgi module to expedite library load time.
> -   Added support for SHA-256 and SHA-512 digest auth algorithms.
> -   Minor performance improvement to `Request.content`.
> -   Migrate to using collections.abc for 3.7 compatibility.
> 
> **Bugfixes**
>
