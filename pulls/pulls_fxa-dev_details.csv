When changes are pushed to mozilla/123done, I've tested that the image changes are picked up, and that if `rp|rp-untrusted` containers exist, they are retired. 

Teamcity tests do as well as they do against `latest` with the current set of images, with a handful or less of test failures.

Essentially the string will be passed as the argument to the `RegExp` constructor, so the leading and trailing slashes that got added were wrong. In addition to that I've made a couple more tweaks:
- I've escaped the quoting backslashes so that they make it into the parsed regex, rather than a dot literal which matches any character.
- I've moved the starting `^` and terminating `$` matches outside of the group, to try and make the two types of email a little clearer.

When it hits the limit (32 given the size of RDS instance), 20 of the connections are consumed by the oauth and oauth-internal daemons. I don't think they really need this many connections, but do so because they are configured to grab 10 in a block. So just lower this to something less greedy.
(The other approach is to change max_connections on RDS to something higher, but that requires created a custom parameter list for RDS and using that list with the instance. It's simpler just to have oauth not be so greedy).

I've built new stacks with both nodejs 0.10 and 4.x and passed intern functional tests on 4.x, but this change could be disruptive during the ansible update on an existing stack like latest.dev.lcip.org, or per-person stacks. If it's r+, I'll merge this at a time that I can fix any issues that arise.

A major set of updates:
- changes the default ec2 instance from m3.medium to t2.small (which counter-intuitively provides better performance in tests I have run, but at a lower cost. The tests also show that they will not run short of CPU credits under typical fxa-dev usage, so no worries about that).
- fixes #174 by inverting the build order of authdb and auth; it's still a bit odd to have authdb peeking at the auth config, but it suffices.
- updates the AMI to use the latest Amazon Linux AMI using HVM (not PV) virtualization.
- the ec2 instance type can now be chosen if t2.small doesn't fit the use case.
- disk size is also now configurable, but almost all use cases of fxa-dev will be fine with the default.
- implicitly updates to boto@2.38.0/python@2.7.10 on the server by moving to the latest amzn AMI.
- works around a couple of problems introduced with boto@2.38.0/python@2.7.10.

NOTE: these updates do mean that I will be rebuilding `latest` and `stage` to switch to the different AMI/etc, so do not merge this PR as I'll need to pick a time for updating those boxes that works with users of those boxes. It also means that any user of fxa-dev who does a `make foo` to update their `foo` box might be surprised that it will be replaced with a new stack.

The pip install of virtualenv does not work with --install-option as expected and keeps putting virtualenv in /usr/local/bin. (I think an upgraded version of pip may fix this bug, but, ugh, what a load of crap).

Anyways, this change will just ignore errors on the symlink. I don't like it a lot, but it solves an immediate problem that `latest.dev.lcip.org` fails to update without this change. 

I also did this by registering the result of `test -f /usr/bin/virtualenv` and only trying the symlink if that file does not already exist. But seemed too much; the symlink is unlikely to fail in the new box case, and it will be quite clear that there's an error when the sync role tries to run virtualenv and can't find it.
