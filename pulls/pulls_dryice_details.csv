Did you know that `path.{exists,existsSync}` was moved to `fs.{exists,existsSync}`,  and that `tty.setRawMode(mode)` was moved to `tty.ReadStream#setRawMode()` (i.e. `process.stdin.setRawMode()`)  in node v0.8.0? Read more @[API changes between v0.6 and v0.8](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/API-changes-between-v0.6-and-v0.8) 

I automatically made some changes I think will help you migrate your codebase to node v0.8.0, please review these changes and merge them if you feel they are useful, If they are not you can ignore this Pull Request.
