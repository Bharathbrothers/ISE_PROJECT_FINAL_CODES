0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/gamesaver/pulls/2,2,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"
As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please reach out to Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

1,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/gamesaver/pulls/1,1,Test suite,"Started on the GameSaver server test suite code using Vows+APIEasy, as well as a couple of simple tests regarding saving/loading. Right now it simply doesn't check any BrowserID verification if the server is started up in a testing mode, which will allow the test suite access to the server APIs. Eventually, BrowserID verification should also be tested in the server tests as well instead of being bypassed.
