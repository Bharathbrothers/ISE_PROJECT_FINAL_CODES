There I'm going to inline `_GetNextMapEntryForIterator` intrinsic, that is used in `%MapIteratorPrototype%.next`.
The inlined `_GetNextMapEntryForIterator` supports only boxed array for `mapIterationResultPair` (the temporary array to receive key-value pair from native function), and I expect some performance regression when unboxed array is enabled, and it's somehow used as `mapIterationResultPair` array (created in `MapIteratorObject::createResultPair`), as inlined code will be no more used for that case.

Locally, the inlining patch improves the score of this test from 252.0ms to 89.2ms.  So once this inlining become inapplicable, the score will be regressed to similar score as before.

To track it, I'd like to add this test.
