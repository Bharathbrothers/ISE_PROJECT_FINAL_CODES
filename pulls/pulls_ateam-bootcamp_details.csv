0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/ateam-bootcamp/pulls/14,14,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #13


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

I didn't build the docs locally, but I mimicked the markup style for the related link, and it works fine on my local Github branch.

I added 'A-team' as a qualifier for the best practices, which while I'm sure they all make total sense, sometimes vary subtly from team to team.

Adding @wlach for review.

I went through most of the manual and fixed mostly grammar and style (e.g. officially it's ""GitHub"" not ""Github"", ""Git"" not ""git"", etc.).

I also tried rephrasing some things that appeared awkward to me. Feel free to pick and choose the ones you like.

I expanded on a few sections that were overly specific to websites. However, I didn't touch the Security section, which I think needs a bigger overhaul. I'll file a bug for it.
