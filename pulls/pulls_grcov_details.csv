<blockquote>
<h2>v0.7.2</h2>
<h1>Fixed</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fix macro hygiene for expansion in a <code>no_implicit_prelude</code> context (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/colin-kiegel/rust-pretty-assertions/issues/70"">#70</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/tommilligan""><code>@​tommilligan</code></a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.7.1</h2>
<h2>Fixed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug where multiline changes showed an unhelpful inline diff (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/colin-kiegel/rust-pretty-assertions/issues/66"">#66</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/tommilligan""><code>@​tommilligan</code></a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.7.0</h2>
<h2>Changed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Move from <code>difference</code> to <code>diff</code> for calculating diffs. The exact assertion messages generated may differ from previous versions. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/colin-kiegel/rust-pretty-assertions/issues/52"">#52</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/tommilligan""><code>@​tommilligan</code></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following assertion message from <code>v0.7.0</code>:</p>
<p><img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colin-kiegel/rust-pretty-assertions/2d2357ff56d22c51a86b2f1cfe6efcee9f5a8081/examples/pretty_assertion.png"" alt=""pretty assertion"" /></p>

<h2>Added</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support for unsized values (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/colin-kiegel/rust-pretty-assertions/issues/42"">#42</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/stanislav-tkach""><code>@​stanislav-tkach</code></a>)</li>
<li>Document the <code>Comparison</code> struct, which was previously hidden. This can be used to generate a pretty diff of two values without panicking. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/colin-kiegel/rust-pretty-assertions/issues/52"">#52</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/tommilligan""><code>@​tommilligan</code></a>)</li>

<blockquote>
<h1>1.4.5 (2021-03-14)</h1>
<p>This is a small patch release that fixes a regression in the size of a <code>Regex</code>
in the 1.4.4 release. Prior to 1.4.4, a <code>Regex</code> was 552 bytes. In the 1.4.4
release, it was 856 bytes due to internal changes. In this release, a <code>Regex</code>
is now 16 bytes. In general, the size of a <code>Regex</code> was never something that was
on my radar, but this increased size in the 1.4.4 release seems to have crossed
a threshold and resulted in stack overflows in some programs.</p>
<ul>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/750"">#750</a>](<a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/750"">rust-lang/regex#750</a>):
Fixes stack overflows seemingly caused by a large <code>Regex</code> size by decreasing
its size.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.4.4 (2021-03-11)</h1>
<p>This is a small patch release that contains some bug fixes. Notably, it also
drops the <code>thread_local</code> (and <code>lazy_static</code>, via transitivity) dependencies.</p>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/362"">#362</a>](<a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/362"">rust-lang/regex#362</a>):
Memory leaks caused by an internal caching strategy should now be fixed.</li>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/576"">#576</a>](<a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/576"">rust-lang/regex#576</a>):
All regex types now implement <code>UnwindSafe</code> and <code>RefUnwindSafe</code>.</li>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/728"">#728</a>](<a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/749"">rust-lang/regex#749</a>):

<blockquote>
<h2>[0.4.13] - 2021-01-11</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is the same as <code>0.4.11</code>, except with a <code>kv_unstable_std</code> feature added to aid migrating current dependents to <code>0.4.14</code> (which was originally going to be <code>0.4.13</code> until it was decided to create a patch from <code>0.4.11</code> to minimize disruption).</li>
</ul>
<h2>[0.4.12] - 2020-12-24</h2>
<h3>New</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support platforms without atomics by racing instead of failing to compile</li>
<li>Implement <code>Log</code> for <code>Box&lt;T: Log&gt;</code></li>
<li>Update <code>cfg-if</code> to <code>1.0</code></li>
<li>Internal reworks of the structured logging API. Removed the <code>Fill</code> API
and added <code>source::as_map</code> and <code>source::as_list</code> to easily serialize a <code>Source</code>
as either a map of <code>{key: value, ..}</code> or as a list of <code>[(key, value), ..]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed deserialization of <code>LevelFilter</code> to use their <code>u64</code> index variants</li>

<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/releases"">symbolic-common's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>8.0.2</h2>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include third-party submodules to allow the Python <code>sdist</code> to build again. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/310"">#310</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>8.0.1</h2>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute correct debug identifiers when proessing a Minidump from a machine with opposite endianness. This particularly allows to process MIPS minidumps on little-endian hosts. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/281"">#281</a>)</li>
<li>Update the breakpad processor with better stack scanning heuristics. Some false-positive frames are avoided during stack scanning now. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/281"">#281</a>)</li>
<li>Avoid panics when processing UE4 crash logs containing ambiguous local times. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/307"">#307</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>8.0.0</h2>
<p><strong>Breaking Changes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usage of <code>failure</code> was removed, and all error types were changed to only implement <code>std::error::Error</code> and related traits.</li>
<li><code>symbolic-proguard</code> was removed in favor of the <code>proguard</code> crate. Proguard is still supported via <code>symbolic-cabi</code> and the python API however.</li>
<li>Deprecated APIs have been removed:
<ul>
<li><code>InstructionInfo</code>'s fields are no longer public.</li>
<li><code>pointer_size</code>, <code>instruction_alignment</code> and <code>ip_register_name</code> have moved from <code>Arch</code> to <code>CpuFamily</code>.</li>
<li><code>Arch::register_name</code> as been moved to <code>CpuFamily::cfi_register_name</code>.</li>
<li><code>Dwarf::raw_data</code> and <code>Dwarf::section_data</code> have been replaced with the <code>raw_section</code> and <code>section</code> APIs.</li>
<li><code>Unreal4ContextRuntimeProperties::misc_primary_cpu_brand</code> is has been removed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deprecated Python APIs have been removed:
<ul>
<li><code>CodeModule.id</code> and <code>CodeModule.name</code> Use <code>debug_id</code> and <code>code_file</code>, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>DemangleFormat</code> and public fields of <code>DemangleOptions</code> have been removed in favor of builder methods on <code>DemangleOptions</code>.</li>
<li><code>Name::new</code> now takes both the <code>NameMangling</code> state, and the <code>Language</code> explicitly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for the <code>wasm32</code> architecture. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/166"">#166</a>)</li>
<li>Support demangling for Swift 5.3. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/282"">#282</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect mangled anonymous namespaces in PDB inlinees (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/261"">#261</a>)</li>
<li>Fix a panic due to undefined behavior. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/287"">#287</a>)</li>
<li>Skip line program sequences at 0. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/291"">#291</a>)</li>
<li>Prefer DWARF names for Dart functions. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/293"">#293</a>)</li>

47,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/grcov/pulls/546,546,Do not ignore subfolder with name equal to root,"Before this commit, a subfolder with the same name as the root/source folder would be ignored from the coverage reports (see https://github.com/mozilla/grcov/issues/483). This was occurring because the ancestor of the subfolder was being pruned (because it matched the end of the source folder) in the method used to guess the absolute path.

Before this commit, a subfolder with the same name as the root/source
folder would be ignored from the coverage reports (see
https://github.com/mozilla/grcov/issues/483). This was occurring because
the ancestor of the subfolder was being pruned (because it matched the
end of the source folder) in the method used to guess the absolute path.
This resulted in an incorrect guess of the absolute path.

<h2>v0.8.0</h2>
<pre><code>- Switch from `term` to `termcolor` (PR [#59](https://github.com/drakulix/simplelog.rs/issues/59). credits to @raybritton)
- Fix typo in docs (PR [#58](https://github.com/drakulix/simplelog.rs/issues/58), credits to @anthonyjmartinez)
- Switch default padding to `Off`. Padding is annoyingly controversal, just set it to whatever you prefer, if you want it.

<h1>1.4.2 (2020-11-01)</h1>
<p>This is a small bug fix release that bans <code>\P{any}</code>. We previously banned empty
classes like <code>[^\w\W]</code>, but missed the <code>\P{any}</code> case. In the future, we hope
to permit empty classes.</p>

</ul>
<h1>1.4.1 (2020-10-13)</h1>

<code>Format</code> general category.</p>

Fixes bug that prevented <code>\p{cf}</code> from working.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.4.0 (2020-10-11)</h1>
<p>This releases has a few minor documentation fixes as well as some very minor
API additions. The MSRV remains at Rust 1.28 for now, but this is intended to
increase to at least Rust 1.41.1 soon.</p>
<p>This release also adds support for OSS-Fuzz. Kudos to

<blockquote>
<h2>0.4.18</h2>
<ul>
<li>Restore support for x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.4.17</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix a name resolution error in wasm-bindgen code introduced by removing the dependency on time
v0.1</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.4.16</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add %Z specifier to the <code>FromStr</code>, similar to the glibc strptime
(does not set the offset from the timezone name)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop the dependency on time v0.1, which is deprecated, unless the <code>oldtime</code>
feature is active. This feature is active by default in v0.4.16 for backwards
compatibility, but will likely be removed in v0.5. Code that imports
<code>time::Duration</code> should be switched to import <code>chrono::Duration</code> instead to
avoid breakage.</p>

131,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/grcov/pulls/470,470,Create Dependabot config file,":wave: Dependabot is moving natively into GitHub! This pull request migrates your configuration from Dependabot.com to a config file, using the [new syntax](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates). When you merge this pull request, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!

With this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov/network/updates), rather than the [Dependabot dashboard](https://app.dependabot.com/), to monitor your version updates. Dependabot is now configured exclusively using config files.









Your account was configured to allow an unlimited number of open pull requests. This option is no longer supported in the new config file so it has been changed to `99`.


If you've got any questions or feedback for us, please let us know by creating an issue in the [dependabot/dependabot-core](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues) repository.

<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon/blob/master/RELEASES.md"">rayon's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Release rayon 1.3.1 / rayon-core 1.7.1 (2020-06-15)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a use-after-free race in calls blocked between two rayon thread pools.</li>
<li>Collecting to an indexed <code>Vec</code> now drops any partial writes while unwinding,
rather than just leaking them. If dropping also panics, Rust will abort.
<ul>
<li>Note: the old leaking behavior is considered <em>safe</em>, just not ideal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The new <code>IndexedParallelIterator::step_by()</code> adapts an iterator to step
through items by the given count, like <code>Iterator::step_by()</code>.</li>
<li>The new <code>ParallelSlice::par_chunks_exact()</code> and mutable equivalent
<code>ParallelSliceMut::par_chunks_exact_mut()</code> ensure that the chunks always have
the exact length requested, leaving any remainder separate, like the slice
methods <code>chunks_exact()</code> and <code>chunks_exact_mut()</code>.</li>

<h2>v1.0.55</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix missing build script required for using <code>float_roundtrip</code> (<a href=""https://github.com/serde-rs/json/releases/tag/v1.0.54"">https://github.com/serde-rs/json/releases/tag/v1.0.54</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v1.0.54</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add <a href=""https://github.com/serde-rs/json/blob/v1.0.54/Cargo.toml#L58-L65""><code>float_roundtrip</code></a> feature to enable a slower but higher precision float parser based on <a href=""https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/rust-lexical"">lexical</a>.</p>
<p>Enabling <code>float_roundtrip</code> will use sufficient precision when parsing fixed precision floats from JSON to ensure that they maintain accuracy when round-tripped through JSON. This comes at an approximately 2x performance cost for parsing floats compared to the default best-effort precision.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>arbitrary_precision</code>, the new <code>float_roundtrip</code> feature makes f64 -&gt; JSON -&gt; f64 produce output identical to the input. <code>arbitrary_precision</code> is for making JSON -&gt; serde_json::Number -&gt; JSON produce output identical to the input.</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>1.3.9 (2020-05-28)</h1>
<p>This release fixes a MSRV (Minimum Support Rust Version) regression in the
1.3.8 release. Namely, while 1.3.8 compiles on Rust 1.28, it actually does not
compile on other Rust versions, such as Rust 1.39.</p>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/685"">#685</a>](<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/685"">rust-lang/regex#685</a>):
Remove use of <code>doc_comment</code> crate, which cannot be used before Rust 1.43.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.3.8 (2020-05-28)</h1>
<p>This release contains a couple of important bug fixes driven
by better support for empty-subexpressions in regexes. For
example, regexes like <code>b|</code> are now allowed. Major thanks to
<a href=""https://github.com/sliquister"">@sliquister</a> for implementing support for this
in <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/677"">#677</a>.</p>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/523"">#523</a>](<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/523"">rust-lang/regex#523</a>):
Add note to documentation that spaces can be escaped in <code>x</code> mode.</li>
<li>[BUG <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/524"">#524</a>](<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/524"">rust-lang/regex#524</a>):

<h2>v1.13.0</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>add Linux cgroups support when calling <code>get()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Linux cgroups are a way to restrict the amount of resources a container can use. With this change, most libraries and applications deciding the number of threads to use via <code>num_cpus::get()</code> will spawn less threads, resulting in better usage of the CPU, and typically perform better.</p>

<h1>1.3.4 (2020-01-30)</h1>
<p>This is a small bug fix release that fixes a bug related to the scoping of
flags in a regex. Namely, before this fix, a regex like <code>((?i)a)b)</code> would
match <code>aB</code> despite the fact that <code>b</code> should not be matched case insensitively.</p>

255,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/grcov/pulls/366,366,Fill out `git` key in Coveralls report,"Fixes #362.

Compare:
* reports about pushes to branches: [grcov](https://coveralls.io/builds/27771141) vs. [cpp-coveralls](https://coveralls.io/builds/27779819)
* reports about pull requests: [grcov](https://coveralls.io/builds/27771704) vs. [cpp-coveralls](https://coveralls.io/builds/27780156)

Even though the code in this PR is very close to code in [cpp-coveralls](https://github.com/eddyxu/cpp-coveralls/blob/ff7af7eea2a23828f6ab2541667ea04f94344dce/cpp_coveralls/gitrepo.py), results differ:
- grcov reports names from Git, cpp-coveralls reports GitHub handles. I've no idea why this happens;
- for pull requests, grcov reports about a merge commit that GitHub creates, while cpp-coveralls reports about the commit that's being merged (i.e. the tip of the PR). I can explain grcov's behaviour (tl;dr: I pass it $TRAVIS_COMMIT, which is basically Git HEAD), but I've no idea what's going on with cpp-coveralls (it runs `git log` so should report on HEAD as well).

Neither of these differences are a deal-breaker to me, though.

I'm not sure how to best test all of this. If I change integration tests to pass a real commit SHA to `--commit-sha`, I'll have to wrap each dataset into a fake Git repository. I could write a small integration test just for `get_coveralls_git_info`, but I'll have to make it public—which seems lame.

> ## [0.4.10] - 2019-12-16
> 
> ### Fixed
> 
> * Fixed the `log!` macros so they work in expression context (this regressed in `0.4.9`, which has been yanked).
> 
> ## [0.4.9] - 2019-12-12
> 
> ### Minimum Supported Rust Version
> 
> This release bumps the minimum compiler version to `1.31.0`. This was mainly needed for `cfg-if`,
> but between `1.16.0` and `1.31.0` there are a lot of language and library improvements we now
> take advantage of.
> 
> ### New
> 
> * Unstable support for capturing key-value pairs in a record using the `log!` macros
> 
> ### Improved
> 
> * Better documentation for max level filters.
> * Internal updates to line up with bumped MSRV

*Sourced from [chrono's changelog](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).*

> ## 0.4.10
> 
> ### Improvements
> 
> * `DateTime::parse_from_str` is more than 2x faster in some cases. ([@&#8203;michalsrb](https://github.com/michalsrb)
>   [#358](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/358))
> * Significant improvements to no-std and alloc support (This should also make
>   many format/serialization operations induce zero unnecessary allocations)
>   ([@&#8203;CryZe](https://github.com/CryZe) [#341](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/341))
> 
> ### Features
> 
> * Functions that were accepting `Iterator` of `Item`s (for example
>   `format_with_items`) now accept `Iterator` of `Borrow<Item>`, so one can
>   use values or references. ([@&#8203;michalsrb](https://github.com/michalsrb) [#358](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/358))
> * Add built-in support for structs with nested `Option<Datetime>` etc fields
>   ([@&#8203;manifest](https://github.com/manifest) [#302](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/302))
> 
> ### Internal/doc improvements
> 
> * Use markdown footnotes on the `strftime` docs page ([@&#8203;qudlibetor](https://github.com/qudlibetor) [#359](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/359))
> * Migrate from `try!` -> `?` (question mark) because it is now emitting
>   deprecation warnings and has been stable since rustc 1.13.0
> * Deny dead code

<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>

*Sourced from [regex's changelog](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).*

> 1.3.1 (2019-09-04)
> ==================
> This is a maintenance release with no changes in order to try to work-around
> a [docs.rs/Cargo issue](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/docs.rs/issues/400).
> 
> 
> 1.3.0 (2019-09-03)
> ==================
> This release adds a plethora of new crate features that permit users of regex
> to shrink its size considerably, in exchange for giving up either functionality
> (such as Unicode support) or runtime performance. When all such features are
> disabled, the dependency tree for `regex` shrinks to exactly 1 crate
> (`regex-syntax`). More information about the new crate features can be
> [found in the docs](https://docs.rs/regex/*/#crate-features).
> 
> Note that while this is a new minor version release, the minimum supported
> Rust version for this crate remains at `1.28.0`.
> 
> New features:
> 
> * [FEATURE [#474](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/474)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/474):
>   The `use_std` feature has been deprecated in favor of the `std` feature.
>   The `use_std` feature will be removed in regex 2. Until then, `use_std` will
>   remain as an alias for the `std` feature.
> * [FEATURE [#583](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/583)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/583):
>   Add a substantial number of crate features shrinking `regex`.

im not super sure if there is a better way to make the `CovResultIter` for the benches or if it should include more data or not. i tried messing around with cleaning it up, but couldn't ever get anything working because it gets moved into the closure and any variables declared outside of that box aren't guaranteed to live.

i'm also unsure if writing and removing the files like that is a good idea. it will overwrite and remove a file of the same name if it's there. `output_covdir` at least will write all of that data to the terminal if you pass it a `None`, tho, so we need to pass something in.

the function signature of the `thread::consumer` also changed and required an extra boolean arg in `benches/lib.rs` on line 118. all the other changes are white space from running rustfmt

im not super sure if there is a better way to make the `CovResultIter` for the benches or if it should include more data or not. i tried messing around with cleaning it up, but couldn't ever get anything working because it gets moved into the closure and any variables declared outside of that box aren't guaranteed to live.

i'm also unsure if writing and removing the files like that is a good idea. it will overwrite and remove a file of the same name if it's there. `output_covdir` at least will write all of that data to the terminal if you pass it a `None`, tho, so we need to pass something in.

the function signature of the `thread::consumer` also changed and required an extra boolean arg in `benches/lib.rs` on line 118. all the other changes are white space from running rustfmt

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
