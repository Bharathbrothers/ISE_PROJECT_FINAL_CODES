extended init attributes
started storing attributes in private (_) namespace
moved basic work to methods
added SOAP 1.2 support TODO: doesn't seem to be working yet
Attempt to be able to change between WSDLs without creating a new instance
Toying with idea of changing the mapper functiosn to just use getattr override.  This looses dynamic wsdl loading capability though.
Added inline test when api is run directly."
