* Remove unused code to directly deploy to GKE.
* Simplify the command to build a Docker image. The old version still had relics from the time when we built different Docker images for each Kubernetes job.
* Update orb versions to the latest releases.
* Whenever the `dev` branch is updated, an image tagged with the SHA1 of the commit is pushed to Docker Hub. These images will automatically be deployed to the dev env.
* Whenever the `main` branch is updated, an image with the `latest` tag is pushed to Docker Hub. These images will automatically be deployed to the stage environment.
* Whenever a tag starting with the later `v` is pushed, an image with the same tag will be published. These images don't trigger any automatic deployment – they are meant for manual deployment to the prod environment.

3. The Intermediates update and the Filter does not.
4. None update.

In practice, we can choose between the second and third bullet by choosing which sign-off occurs first, as if it fails, then the second also will not happen. Right now, the Filter tries to update first, so the third option can be practically discounted, pending code changes.
