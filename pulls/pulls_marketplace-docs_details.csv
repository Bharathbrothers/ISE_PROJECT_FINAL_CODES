- Commonplace Fiddle is deprecated and will be removed
- I tried to make things more concise. Make it clear to contributors the paths they can go down, backend or frontend or both. Made the setup page more a gateway to the frontend/Docker docs.
- Removed some duplicate stuff from the setup docs vs the frontend docs
- Updated frontend docs to recommend WebIDE, and updated some commands.
- Added more repositories. Maybe it can be our canonicial list.
