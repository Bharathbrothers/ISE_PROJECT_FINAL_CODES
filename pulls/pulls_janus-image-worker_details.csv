0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/janus-image-worker/pulls/9,9,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #8


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

4,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/janus-image-worker/pulls/1,1,Fixed npm install error: files were missing,"Salut Sylvain,

Firstly I want to thank you for developing this project!

Last day I wanted to compile `node-janus` but I wasn't able to do that due to a compilation error. After having a look to the error, it seems that it was due to the installation of `janus-image-worker`:

```
✓ mozjpeg downloaded successfully
✓ jpeg turbo downloaded successfully
✓ jpeg-turbo built successfully.
✓ mozjpeg built successfully.

✗ Unable to build image recompressor.
/bin/sh: 1: ./configure: not found
```

Most of the files were missing due to the `files` key in `packages.json` file. It's a problem when we have to build the recompressor because we need all files needed to compile this project.
This is why I removed the `files` key.

Maybe there is a better solution but it seems this one will fix the problem :-)

Have a good day,

Matt
