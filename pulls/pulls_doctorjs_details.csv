This commit only impacts on the Makefile, which means it does not have side-effects on the rest of the project.

Please review it. There may be a more straightforward manner.
- Added `LIB_CFA2_SRC` since the position of cfa has moved away from `narcissus/`;
- Modified `LIB_NARCISSUS_SRC` since narcissus itself has moved away from `lib/`;
- Corrected `make uninstall` as well.

40,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/doctorjs/pulls/2,2,--sort flag (as found in Exuberant Ctags),"I've implemented the `--sort` flag to mimic the one found in Exuberant Ctags:
- `--sort=no` sorts by line number (a little unintuitive, I know, but that's how ctags does it)
- `--sort=yes` sorts alphabetically on the tag names

Ctags has yet another option -- `foldcase` -- which I haven't implemented here.

I'm working on integrating jsctags with the taglist.vim plugin, and this flag will ease that process. It's a more elegant solution than doing the sorting in the plugin itself.

Do let me know if there's anything I should improve about the code. Thanks!

42,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/doctorjs/pulls/1,1,Untitled,"Hi,

I've added the ability for jsctags to print to stdout.

I've also added the `-f` tag as an alternative for the `-o` tag, in line with ctag's behavior.

Both changes will help integrate it with existing editor plugins that were built for ctags.

I sent this pull request to pcwalton's branch previously, but it seems to have disappeared.. seeing as there's an official mozilla branch now, I'm trying again. Hope to hear from you guys.

Regards,
Jez
