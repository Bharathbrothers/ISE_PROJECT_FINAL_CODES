12:27:48 Commit message : Bug 1076810 - RelEng CI tests should be available over the internet, add irc notifications for balrog-ui repository,r=mgerva
12:27:48 travis-ci left the room.

I already put the r=mgerva in the commit message, so that if you accept the merge request, the comment will reflect it. This commit only lives in my own personal fork at the moment.

Thanks,
Pete
