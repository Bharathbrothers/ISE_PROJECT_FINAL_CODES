As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

1. How come I can't seem to get the locations for each window tab on line 65? When I use pdb, apparently an exception like ""**\* NoSuchWindowException: NoSuchWindowException: Unable to locate window: 2147483649"" is being fired when I try to access the location, but the testing framework never tells me that itself. What can I do to access each tabs location?
2. Even if I remote the bit where I access the tab locations, this test never exits. It'll just sit there forever. What am I doing wrong that's preventing this test from exiting?

This gets tests passing again, but doesn't integrate window switching/handling with our ui libraries nicely at all. I'm thinking we could have something like ""find_opened_window()"" in the browser class or a neighboring class that would return the new window handle when taking an action that results in a window opening to avoid the tedious pattern I have here. @whimboo, what do you think?
