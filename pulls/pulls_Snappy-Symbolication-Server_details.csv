We apply some OOP to symbol fetching here. The concept of a symbol
fetcher object is a interface which will receive a lib and a breakpad id
and return the respective SymbolInfo object, or None if the SymbolInfo
object is not found.

There are currently two fetchers:
* PathFetcher: look for symbol files in local paths.
* URLFetcher: look for symbol files in a remote path.

by one until either one of them returns a SymbolInfo or all fetchers
are called."
