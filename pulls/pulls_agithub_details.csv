Updated Changelog"
28,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/agithub/pulls/49,49,Add support for GitHub pagination and ratelimiting,"Create a new `GitHubClient` class which extends the `Client` class by modifying
the `request` method and creating four new methods
* Establish a new `paginate` parameter to the constructor
* Modify the `request` method to
  * check if there aren't any allowed requests remaining due to ratelimiting
    and if so wait the designated amount of time before making the request.
  * if the `paginate` parameter is true, look in the payload of the response
    page for a [link header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) and if found
    extend the fetched data by calling the `get_additional_pages` method
* Create the `no_ratelimit_remaining` method to check if there are no
  remaining requests allowed
* Create the `get_additional_pages` method which calls the
  `get_next_link_url` method to determine if there are additional pages. If
  so, fetch the next page and recursively continue fetching pages until the
  last page is fetched
* Create the `get_next_link_url` method which parses the link header and
  either returns the next page if there is one or an empty string if not
* Create the `ratelimit_seconds_remaining` method which returns the number
  of seconds remaining until the ratelimit is cleared

This new functionality can be used like this

```
>>> from agithub.GitHub import GitHub
>>> g = GitHub(token='token', paginate=True)
>>> status, data = g.issues.get(filter='subscribed', foobar='llama')
```

Based on conversations [with jpaugh and nnja](https://github.com/mozilla/agithub/pull/41#issuecomment-388512427) indicating we're going to redo the unit tests from scratch, I removed my in progress unit tests from this branch and figured I'd submit it now to make it available to folks despite the lack of unit tests.

This fixes #10
