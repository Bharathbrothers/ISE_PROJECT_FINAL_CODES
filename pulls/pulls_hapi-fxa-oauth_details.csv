0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/hapi-fxa-oauth/pulls/10,10,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #9


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

Also, not sure if we want to specify the `peerDependencies` in the package.json file. IIRC, those have been removed in **npm@3** and are no longer automatically installed. Which may not be so bad, since it seems to currently be installing **hapi@11.0.2** locally for me (which I believe requires **node@4+** -- per github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/2764).

It allows the oauth server to be specified as a single url rather than independent (host, port) values.

No tests here, but i tested it with https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/pull/1070 using both `oauth.host` and `oauth.url` configuration options and it all seemed to work OK.
