the string terminates.

For self closing tags, manually call onclosetag to ensure
the element is popped off the stack and the tests complete

As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

10,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/grunt-l10n-lint/pulls/1,1,fix(docs): clarify the description of the checking logic,"@shane-tomlinson, I found some of the readme a bit tricky to parse so here is an attempt to improve it, hope you don't mind. Feel free to ignore, I don't know whether this makes things better or not.

The bits I found confusing were the descriptions of the checking logic:
- It wasn't clear that you were using `<a>`, `<span>` and so on as examples at first. I thought the descriptions were literally just about those specific tags.
- Repeating the `Can have ... elements` in the points about attributes/values muddied the waters for me, because the element bit had already been covered. Ditto chucking the `<div>` element in to the same points.

So, my changes are:
1. To add a general description for the unexpected tags/attributes/values points. And then to prefix the example bullets with `For instance:`.
2. To try and make each of those points self-contained, assuming knowledge of definitions from each of the preceding points. 
3. And there was also one typo, which I took the opportunity to fix.
