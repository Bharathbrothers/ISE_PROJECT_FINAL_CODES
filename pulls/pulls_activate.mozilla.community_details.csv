I have worked today **updating, improving and adding new translations**, are not complete yet, but we will work collaboratively among volunteers and then we'll send new translations ASAP.

**Some observations are important:**

- I not find any files to add translations of the activities (summary, type of activity, name and time) located in the home page and in the footer.
- Our language is derived from Portuguese from Portugal, but our Portuguese is Brazilian, so the correct one is use PT-BR. It is not good practice to use PT for Brazilian Portuguese, because our community in Portugal may want to translate this project in the future and they will want to use PT in the ""lang"".
- Finally, I believe that some updates are need in the FAQ page.

Cheers 👍
