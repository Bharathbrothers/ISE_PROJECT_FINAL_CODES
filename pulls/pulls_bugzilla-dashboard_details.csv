<li>Node.js treats <code>warn</code> the same as <code>error</code> and that was problematic.</li>
<li>You (or perhaps your indirect dependency) may disable the notice with
the <code>hideUpgradeWarningAcceptNoSupportOrSecurityUpdates</code> option</li>
<li>You can also set <code>HLJS_HIDE_UPGRADE_WARNING=yes</code> in your envionment to disable the warning</li>

<h2>Release v9.18.5</h2>
<p><strong>Version 9 has reached end-of-support and will not receive future updates or fixes.</strong></p>
<p>Please see <a href=""https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/master/VERSION_10_UPGRADE.md"">VERSION_10_UPGRADE.md</a> and perhaps <a href=""https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/master/SECURITY.md"">SECURITY.md</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>enh: Post-install script can be disabled with <code>HLJS_HIDE_UPGRADE_WARNING=yes</code></li>
<li>fix: Deprecation notice logged at library startup a <code>console.log</code> vs <code>console.warn</code>.
<ul>
<li>Notice only shown if actually highlighting code, not just requiring the library.</li>
<li>Node.js treats <code>warn</code> the same as <code>error</code> and that was problematic.</li>
<li>You (or perhaps your indirect dependency) may disable the notice with
the <code>hideUpgradeWarningAcceptNoSupportOrSecurityUpdates</code> option</li>
<li>You can also set <code>HLJS_HIDE_UPGRADE_WARNING=yes</code> in your envionment to disable the warning</li>
</ul>

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add ""no-prototype-builtins"" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of ""properties that must be enumerable"".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the ""lookup""-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.
>

Hi @armenzg, I ""reverted"" two diffs you showed in the issue's description. I also changed a little bit in function `findReportees` of `getAllFakeReportees.js`, because the user's email is not in fake data. This is the change:

```javascript
 const allEmails = Object.keys(completeOrg);
 const fakeEmail = (email in completeOrg) ? email : allEmails[allEmails.length - 1];

 allReportees[email] = completeOrg[fakeEmail];
 const { reportees } = completeOrg[fakeEmail];
```

However, the result looks different from the old version, so maybe I did something wrong because I don't understand the context. Please help me to check. Thank you!

Hi @armenzg, I ""reverted"" two diffs you showed in the issue's description. I also changed a little bit in function `findReportees` of `getAllFakeReportees.js`, because the user's email is not in fake data. This is the change:

```javascript
 const allEmails = Object.keys(completeOrg);
 const fakeEmail = (email in completeOrg) ? email : allEmails[allEmails.length - 1];

 allReportees[email] = completeOrg[fakeEmail];
 const { reportees } = completeOrg[fakeEmail];
```

However, the result looks different from the old version, so maybe I did something wrong because I don't understand the context. Please help me to check. Thank you!

* Mozilla hierarchy tree (from @calixteman scrapped data aka `people.json`)
* Bugzilla components with categories & ownership (from @calixteman scrapped data aka `triage_owners.json`)
* an API endpoint provided by **django-rest-framework** under the url `/api/v1/person/<email>`, that gives details about the requested person.

Details provided are:

1. Base data : name / title / email / bugzilla email
2. Manager infos
3. All managed components (directly managed & managed by subordinates)

* Mozilla hierarchy tree (from @calixteman scrapped data aka `people.json`)
* Bugzilla components with categories & ownership (from @calixteman scrapped data aka `triage_owners.json`)
* an API endpoint provided by **django-rest-framework** under the url `/api/v1/person/<email>`, that gives details about the requested person.

Details provided are:

1. Base data : name / title / email / bugzilla email
2. Manager infos

446,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugzilla-dashboard/pulls/1,1,Basic django backend,"This is a POC backend in Django over Python 3 that supports:

* Mozilla hierarchy tree (from @calixteman scrapped data aka `people.json`)
* Bugzilla components with categories & ownership (from @calixteman scrapped data aka `triage_owners.json`)
* an API endpoint provided by **django-rest-framework** under the url `/api/v1/person/<email>`, that gives details about the requested person.

Details provided are:

1. Base data : name / title / email / bugzilla email
2. Manager infos
3. All managed components (directly managed & managed by subordinates)

The tree query is pretty fast as it uses a recursive CTE expression (works on sqlite & postgresql)

Below is a sample output on @sylvestre :
