As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

1,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/UCOSP-winter-2018_TrackingTechnologies/pulls/13,13,Notebook refactor,"I've reviewed the 4 Spark notebooks and done some refactoring, mostly minor. For each notebook:

- reran in Mozilla's Databricks instance, with minor code changes to get the data to load and ensure compatibility with Python 2
- made sure each notebook has a `.ipynb`, `.md`, and `.html` version, the last of which includes all the cell outputs
- removed the .py versions (redundant given the other versions)
- minor code cleanup
- added some more descriptive md cells to make the analyses easier to follow

Notebook-specific comments:

- __Cryptojacking:__ fixed the `.distinct()` call on the base dataset to apply to the union rather than the components. This changes counts, but not by much. The summary sections have been updated to include the new numbers.
- __Session replay:__ deduplicated (page URL, script URL) pairs in computing counts of calls. Rather than counting total function calls (ie. occurrences of scripts weighted by number of calls made to each), this now counts unique occurrences of scripts, which is more appropriate. This changes the values of most numbers in the summary section, but the conclusions remain very similar.
- __Evercookie analysis:__ this analysis currently appears to be incomplete. Only the compatibility code is added, but the notebook was not rerun.

- justification for why each analysis is being performed after the analysis header.
- An interpretation of the results so that their significance can be more easily understood after each result is presented.",Tyler-R,3678054,2018-04-04T08:31:15Z,COLLABORATOR,True,1339,347,12,UCOSP winter cohort internship project to perform exploratory data analysis on tracking technologies on the Web.,Jupyter Notebook,a7f96446cf45e7b568d629108b68bbaba9a30623,"Update the analysis of eval usage.
