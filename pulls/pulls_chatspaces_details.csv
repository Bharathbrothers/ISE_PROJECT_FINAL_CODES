I did some updates on the translation since the portuguese on the file was from Portugal and not from Brazil.

I saw the ""guidelines for contributing"" but since this update is a minor update I thought I could send it and if you guys feel like need to merge at some point or just leave open till things get slowly and then merge.

What do you think of this direction?

Apparently `!!! 5` isn't a thing in Jade anymore in `1.0.0`.

It might be worth restricting `jade` in `package.json` to `~1.0.0` to avoid surprises like this in the future.
