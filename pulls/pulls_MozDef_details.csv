<h2>Version 4.1 - released 2020-06-10</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Python 3.8.</li>
<li>Dropped support for Python 2 and 3.4.</li>
<li>Added type annotations to the source code. This will make Python-RSA easier to use in
your IDE, and allows better type checking.</li>
<li>Added static type checking via <a href=""http://mypy-lang.org/"">MyPy</a>.</li>
<li>Fix <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/129"">#129</a> Installing from source
gives UnicodeDecodeError.</li>
<li>Switched to using <a href=""https://poetry.eustace.io/"">Poetry</a> for package
management.</li>
<li>Added support for SHA3 hashing: SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512. This
is natively supported by Python 3.6+ and supported via a third-party
library on Python 3.5.</li>
<li>Choose blinding factor relatively prime to N. Thanks Christian Heimes for pointing this out.</li>
<li>Reject cyphertexts (when decrypting) and signatures (when verifying) that have
been modified by prepending zero bytes. This resolves CVE-2020-13757. Thanks
Adelapie for pointing this out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.0 - released 2018-09-16</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removed deprecated modules:

<li>Dropped support for Psyco.</li>
<li>Miller-Rabin iterations determined by bitsize of key.
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/pull/58"">#58</a></li>
<li>Added function <code>rsa.find_signature_hash()</code> to return the name of the hashing
algorithm used to sign a message. <code>rsa.verify()</code> now also returns that name,
instead of always returning <code>True</code>.
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/13"">#78</a></li>
<li>Add support for SHA-224 for PKCS1 signatures.

<blockquote>
<p>3.2 - 2020-10-25</p>
<pre><code>
* **SECURITY ISSUE:** Attempted to make RSA PKCS#1v1.5 decryption more constant
  time, to protect against Bleichenbacher vulnerabilities. Due to limitations
  imposed by our API, we cannot completely mitigate this vulnerability and a
  future release will contain a new API which is designed to be resilient to
  these for contexts where it is required. Credit to **Hubert Kario** for
  reporting the issue. *CVE-2020-25659*
* Support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 has been removed. Users on older version of OpenSSL
  will need to upgrade.
* Added basic support for PKCS7 signing (including SMIME) via
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.PKCS7SignatureBuilder`.
<p>.. _v3-1-1:</p>
<p>3.1.1 - 2020-09-22
</code></pre></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Windows, macOS, and <code>manylinux</code> wheels to be compiled with
OpenSSL 1.1.1h.</li>
</ul>
<p>.. _v3-1:</p>
<p>3.1 - 2020-08-26</p>
<pre><code>
* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Removed support for ``idna`` based
  :term:`U-label` parsing in various X.509 classes. This support was originally
  deprecated in version 2.1 and moved to an extra in 2.5.
* Deprecated OpenSSL 1.0.2 support. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is no longer supported by
  the OpenSSL project. The next version of ``cryptography`` will drop support
  for it.
* Deprecated support for Python 3.5. This version sees very little use and will
  be removed in the next release.
* ``backend`` arguments to functions are no longer required and the
  default backend will automatically be selected if no ``backend`` is provided.
* Added initial support for parsing certificates from PKCS7 files with
  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`
  and
  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`
  .
* Calling ``update`` or ``update_into`` on
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext` with ``data``
  longer than 2\ :sup:`31` bytes no longer raises an ``OverflowError``. This
  also resolves the same issue in :doc:`/fernet`.
<p>.. _v3-0:</p>
<p>3.0 - 2020-07-20
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre></p>

The problem I am trying to solve here was detected while working on the [GeoModel Enrichment](https://github.com/mozilla/MozDef/pull/1595) PR in which I determined that, to my surprise, hops were only [partially converted to JSON](https://github.com/mozilla/MozDef/pull/1595/commits/24fbfa3227ce3fef1a666ac4e832e285722e279b) in doing
```py
[dict(hop._asdict()) for hop in alert.hops]
```

This is a result of the fact that a `Hop` is itself a `NamedTuple` which contains `Origin` `NamedTuple`s.  Thus, the top-level `Hop` is converted to a `dict` of the form
```py
{
  ""origin"": Origin(...),
  ""destination"": Origin(...),
}
```

This PR addresses this by adding a method to `Hop` called `to_json()` that performs a deep conversion so that plugins dealing with GeoModel alerts will receive `Hop` data as fully nested JSON.",arcrose,682761,2020-04-03T16:17:28Z,CONTRIBUTOR,True,10,1,2,MozDef: Mozilla Enterprise Defense Platform,Python,efdc57a16f01fec12538fe04f89922eb78e57c5c,Convert the origin and destination of each hop in a geomodel alert to JSON so that plugins can expect dicts and not NamedTuples

2. The `geomodel_ipintel_enrichment.py` alert plugin, which uses the aforementioned intel to enrich geomodel alerts with information about IPs described in the intel JSON.

In particular, the intel data tells us about IPs that are known Tor nodes, belong to a VPN, are known to be used for Bitcoin-related activity etc.  The plugin enriches the alert with any information it can find in a data-oriented way, by appending a `details.ipintel` field containing data such as
```json
{""ip"": ""1.2.3.4"", ""classification"": ""TorNode"", ""threatscore"": 123}

265,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/MozDef/pulls/1594,1594,Enrich GeoModel alerts with information about Tor Nodes and VPNs,"This PR introduces:

1. The `update_ipintel.py` cron task, which downloads and stores IP intel data that we have purchased from ProofPoint.
2. The `geomodel_ipintel_enrichment.py` alert plugin, which uses the aforementioned intel to enrich geomodel alerts with information about IPs described in the intel JSON.

In particular, the intel data tells us about IPs that are known Tor nodes, belong to a VPN, are known to be used for Bitcoin-related activity etc.  The plugin enriches the alert with any information it can find in a data-oriented way, by appending a `details.ipintel` field containing data such as
```json
{""ip"": ""1.2.3.4"", ""classification"": ""TorNode"", ""threatscore"": 123}
```
taken from the intel data.  It also appends to GeoModel a alert's summary to say when it has found an IP that is either a Tor node or a VPN IP in particular.

The following screenshots are taken from a run directly in QA to illustrate the plugin working on an alert triggered with some falsified data (censored here) taken from the IP intel source.

This is a very simple hack to solve this one problem. This is an alternative to the larger solutions proposed in #1303 #1297 so that we can solve this one problem quickly. We still need to come up with a better solution, but just not today.

The notion is that that when these containers come up they'll test for the existence of the Geo IP data file in the docker shared volume. If it's absent the command should fail and the container should stop, then start again (since they're set to `restart: always`. Eventually once the `base` container runs and does the one time fetch, the worker containers should start working

This also clarifies that the `DomainName` parameter is optional. Andrew reports that the basic auth sites work just fine despite passing a domain name to meteor (via the `DomainName` parameter) that doesn't map to the site. If that is indeed true then we can just pass `Unset` to meteor. If that's not true, then we would need to conditionally handle the `Unset` value on the instance side to pass or not pass a domain name to meteor in the [`OPTIONS_METEOR_ROOTURL`](https://github.com/mozilla/MozDef/blob/9fa979337fb165a602f8ca609cb91af6d5f6e1aa/cloudy_mozdef/cloudformation/mozdef-instance.yml#L165) environment variable.

1561,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/MozDef/pulls/1224,1224,"adding basic license config, disables pay for features in kibana.","After 30 days the default trial license expires and generates a warning message at the top of kibana.
To make this not happen, this line will turn on the default basic licensing which will disable the ""pay-for"" features of kibana.

Feel free to close this PR, as the trial license expires there is an option inside the kibana license management to downgrade to the basic license without having this in the kibana config. I only added this to bring awareness and start dialogue should this be considered a desired configuration.

Features turned off:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/license-expiration.html
- **Watcher**
- **Monitoring**
- **Graph**
- **Reporting**
- **Security**
- **Machine learning**
- **Logstash Pipeline Management**

Once the license expires, calls to the cluster health, cluster stats, and index stats APIs fail with a security_exception and return a 403 HTTP status code.

{
  ""error"": {
    ""root_cause"": [
      {
        ""type"": ""security_exception"",
        ""reason"": ""current license is non-compliant for [security]"",

    ""reason"": ""current license is non-compliant for [security]"",

This message enables automatic monitoring systems to easily detect the license failure without immediately impacting other users.

  - **initial_setup.py**
    - dashboard is no longer ""_type"", but ""type""
    - visualization is no longer ""_type"", but ""type""

- **EXTRA**
  - modify whatever sets empty fields to UNKNOWN to ensure that it no longer sets _type as ""UNKNOWN""
  - **Benchmarking**
    - insert_bulk.js needs change _type to ""_doc"" from ""blog""


- **Kibana:**
  - Determine if kibana index name should be cast into a variable
    - This index name appears to get created with a random number (e.g: .kibana_1, kibana_7)

This commit introduces a new function, get_aws_credentials, which accepts AWS

you to conditionally pass or not pass API keys to boto functions depending on

is that by not setting API keys, MozDef will instead rely on the boto access
resoltion methods which include checking local ~/.aws/ files as well as
instance metadata.

This commit also allows the `cloudtrail_arn` variable, which is actually the
ARN of an IAM role, to be optional. If the value is set to the default, it is
ignored and no IAM Role Assumption is done when attempting to fetch data from

3103,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/MozDef/pulls/734,734,Normalization Effort: Part 1: Remove string ip fields **WIP**,"**Do not merge!**

**Purpose of this change:**
With ES 5.x the ip field type now supports both ipv4 and ipv6. This reduces the need to add these additional fields as string fields. This change will reduce the 6 field types we currently use to track IP information to only 2. 

> sourceipaddress (field type ""ip"") <-> no change
> sourceipv4address (field type ""string"") --> sourceipaddress (field type ""ip"")
> sourceipv6address (field type ""string"") --> sourceipaddress (field type ""ip"")
> destinationipaddress (field type ""ip"") <-> no change
> destinationipv4address (field type ""string"") --> destinationipaddress (field type ""ip"")
> destinationipv6address (field type ""string"") --> destinationipaddress (field type ""ip"")


**Left to do:** 
**Test:** 
- bro event types: These are working fine 
- sqsFluentd event types: 
- Aggregations: Will have to check kibana for saved aggregations to see if these will require being rewritten to use the sourceipaddress or destinationipaddress field. There are no aggregations that depend on the string field.
- Visualizations: These use the ipv4address field generated by the CollectAttackers.py script, which bases it on the sourceipaddress field, and uses an isIPv4 function to validate the value and send to mongo. So nothing breaks here.
- Alerting: Alerts appear to be working fine.
- okta2mozdef.py: validated that this script only utilizes the sourceipaddress field and uses a function to validate if it's ipv4.
- createIPBlockList.py: validated that this script only searches for the ipv4address in the mongodb. Out of scope for ES field mappings.
- CollectAttackers : validated that this script only utilizes the sourceipaddress field for it's functionality. It does add an ipv4address field to mongo, but that is not in the scope of our effort.


**Testing Completed:**
- eventtask event types populate correctly.
- unit test completes successfully.

**Number of Alerts that depend on the removed fields: 0** 
**Files with ipv4 or ipv6 strings:**
- CollectAttackers.py
- createIPBlockList.py
- okta2mozdef.py
- geomodel.py
- defaultMappingTemplate.json
- elasticsearch.yml
- examples directory has a lot of files that will need to be cleaned up.

- test_geomodel.py
- test_broFixup.py
- test_parse_sshd.py (not sure why this utilizes an ipv4 string field, when the plugin doesn't use one at all.)
- test_vulnerability.py


It seems like we can still use netaddr to validate if an IP is ipv4 or ipv6 in these scripts, but they don't necessarily need to be fields within the mapping.

**New Finding:**
Seems like aggregation of ipv6 is supported in ES, but not in Kibana using the IP range bucket.
To aggregate the ip field you'd need to use ""Terms"", but ""significant terms"" will omit the IP field.
I created a post on their site to get more information around this.

It seems like we can still use netaddr to validate if an IP is ipv4 or ipv6 in these scripts, but they don't necessarily need to be fields within the mapping.

**New Finding:**
Seems like aggregation of ipv6 is supported in ES, but not in Kibana using the IP range bucket.
To aggregate the ip field you'd need to use ""Terms"", but ""significant terms"" will omit the IP field.

**Purpose of this change:**
With ES 5.x the ip field type now supports both ipv4 and ipv6. This reduces the need to add these additional fields as string fields. This change will reduce the 6 field types we currently use to track IP information to only 2.

- Visualizations: These use the ipv4address field generated by the CollectAttackers.py script, which bases it on the sourceipaddress field, and uses an isIPv4 function to validate the value and send to mongo. So nothing breaks here.
- Alerting: Alerts appear to be working fine.
- okta2mozdef.py: validated that this script only utilizes the sourceipaddress field and uses a function to validate if it's ipv4.
- createIPBlockList.py: validated that this script only searches for the ipv4address in the mongodb. Out of scope for ES field mappings.

single authentication factor (""fail open"").

How does that look like? For example, the aggregation is based on one term only since it makes sense to always alert. But I'm not sure if that's the correct way to do that.

Also, I'm not 100% sure about the term and query filter.  I suppose using _source or directly the name works.. but I'm not sure at all :)

I based myself on https://github.com/jeffbryner/MozDef/blob/master/alerts/bruteforce_ssh_pyes.py
