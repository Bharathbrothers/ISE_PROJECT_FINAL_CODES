- 5.3.1 52877.0927 - the zoom client automatically forces an update to this version right after install, so it makes sense to install this version directly
- change to using the standard installer instead of the IT installer, which needs an additional plist for configuring the zoom client - at some point, the flag below sets to default:

Allow updates through the client by users | Disabled | ZAutoUpdate | Boolean

66,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/dinobuildr/pulls/177,177,Fixing .app installer bug in DMG processor and removing hash checks for the manifest file,"Per https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1592852#c18, a bug was identified in the DMG processor, causing .app installers to be copied into the Applications directory without recursively changing ownership of all the files in the .app bundle to the logged in user. Since we run dinobuildr with sudo, any file in the .app bundle was owned by root - which causes the Firefox updater to prompt the user instead of silently installing updates, which is not ideal. 

We also stop changing the permissions on files in the .app installer, since this should not be required. Finally, we set the group ownership of anything installed inside the.app installer to `admin` since the user is likely going to be in the admin group. This isn't a great assumption, and in a perfect world we would determine if the logged in user is part of the administrators group, but it's a safer assumption than assigning everything to the `staff` group as we were doing previously and better emulates a user clicking and dragging a .app to Applications. 

We also removed the hash check for the manifest file. While this may seem like a security regression, since dino_engine.py and the manifest file are both hosted in Github, the value of the hash check is minimal. We're already trusting the validity of the files in Github, and if an attacker had the opportunity to mess with the manifest file, they have the opportunity to mess with dino_engine.py and subvert the entire hash checking function. 

At a later time, if we start to sign and hash-pin the bootstrap script, we can revisit hashing the manifest, but for now this removes a cumbersome step.

In the future, supporting native Python script execution in Dinobuildr and a little bit of reverse engineering could get us to the point where the user create is in code again.

Yes, that's a password in plaintext, but the user account is unprivileged and has autologin enabled so it's not exactly secret, and extracting the package and reversing the kcpassword file is trivial.

### Wallpaper
It's now harder to set the wallpaper in Mojave without using Configuration Profiles, because any calls to `osascript` need to be authorized by the user, regardless of if `osascript` was called with `sudo` or not. This is actually a good change, as it means that less sketchy stuff can be done with `osascript`, but it means that there is a prompt that you have to click through in our build. I moved this step to right after the OS version check to make it easy to get out of the way quickly.

### Recently Used Apps in the Dock
Apple added a feature where apps that you launch magically appear in the dock in a separate section, and stick around (because, since you launched them, they might be helpful). This is neat, but there is no programmatic way of clearing these dock items, so Terminal will now show up in the user's dock because we use Terminal to set up their machine. I think this is fine, but we can add manual steps to remediate this in the future. 

### Crashplan changes
We were installing Crashplan in kind of a sketchy way. By default, Crashplan auto-launches, which is annoying. Code42 has a way of pre-configuring the installer to avoid this behavior, but it involves injecting post-installation scripts into the installer DMG, which was a pain, so we were just auto-quitting the app after install with a post-installation script. This was lame, and we should've just done this the right way in the first place - so I wrote a proper post-installation script and included all the assets in the build. 

### Generic File Downloader
We can now download generic text files, including scripts, out of our Github repo. This is used to grab the Crashplan pre-installation assets, while keeping them in user-readable plain-text. 

### DMG Handler Cleanup
I needed to clean up the DMG handler a bit so it's a little more verbose about what it's actually doing. I also added a new ""feature"" which is a bit of a work around: if you don't specify an installer path or an `advanced_dmg` command, the handler will just download the DMG.

We can now download generic text files, including scripts, out of our Github repo. This is used to grab the Crashplan pre-installation assets, while keeping them in user-readable plain-text. 

### DMG Handler Cleanup
I needed to clean up the DMG handler a bit so it's a little more verbose about what it's actually doing. I also added a new ""feature"" which is a bit of a work around: if you don't specify an installer path or an `advanced_dmg` command, the handler will just download the DMG. This is useful for pre-installation injection, like we do with Crashplan, but this should be handled by a generic file downloader in the future.

### Wallpaper
It's now harder to set the wallpaper in Mojave without using Configuration Profiles, because any calls to `osascript` need to be authorized by the user, regardless of if `osascript` was called with `sudo` or not. This is actually a good change, as it means that less sketchy stuff can be done with `osascript`, but it means that there is a prompt that you have to click through in our build. I moved this step to right after the OS version check to make it easy to get out of the way quickly.

### Recently Used Apps in the Dock
Apple added a feature where apps that you launch magically appear in the dock in a separate section, and stick around (because, since you launched them, they might be helpful). This is neat, but there is no programmatic way of clearing these dock items, so Terminal will now show up in the user's dock because we use Terminal to set up their machine. I think this is fine, but we can add manual steps to remediate this in the future. 

### Crashplan changes
We were installing Crashplan in kind of a sketchy way. By default, Crashplan auto-launches, which is annoying. Code42 has a way of pre-configuring the installer to avoid this behavior, but it involves injecting post-installation scripts into the installer DMG, which was a pain, so we were just auto-quitting the app after install with a post-installation script. This was lame, and we should've just done this the right way in the first place - so I wrote a proper post-installation script and included all the assets in the build.

391,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/dinobuildr/pulls/90,90,Feature: Arbitrary branch support,"Previously, running dinobuildr against a specific branch required changing the `branch` variable in `config.py`, which was annoying. This PR adds support for ""arbitrary"" branches within the repo and org `config.py` is configured to use. 

This is particularly useful in testing, since a dinobuildr can be used to test arbitrary branches without needing to pull the branch down, change the variable and push back to the development branch (then undo all those changes when the testing is complete).
