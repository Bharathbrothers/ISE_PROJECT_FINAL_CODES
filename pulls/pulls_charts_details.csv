0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/charts/pulls/47,47,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #46


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

I think this is an improvement to dashboard.html as well, since it's no longer ticking the ""nightly"" column for things that are tracking+ for old releases.  It's actually a more substantive change there, since it removes the ""Aurora"" column, and corrects the ""Nightly"" column to actually be about nightly rather than being about nightly or anything else.  (Or maybe that was intentional for some reason, but it's confusing!)

I suspect release-history.html may not be entirely right, though.
