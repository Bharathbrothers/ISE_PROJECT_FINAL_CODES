while working on streaming plugin I noticed that `janus_plugin_result_new` [can be called](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/blob/master/plugins/janus_streaming.c#L2325) with `text` parameter as `NULL`.

`text` parameter gets rendered as `hint` in JSON:
```
hint: ""Text here""
janus: ""ack""
session_id: 3824966362294686
transaction: ""ylzel""
```

In case of `NULL` JSON response just doesn't have `hint` key.

I thought it would be nice to allow to pass empty `text` value, just as we can pass empty `content`.
Thought I am not sure about memory management for `CString` instance.

What do you think?

I thought about test yesterday but I wasn't sure how I could check that string was really colored.

Today I realized that I could just check color's codes in string.
It seems to work fine: fails on before-patch version and passes on after-patch one.

I also added function to build default `LogParameters` struct. Not sure if it's a common practice in Rust but it seems to be rather convenient and helps to avoid duplication.",ivanovaleksey,11523473,2017-10-27T08:21:35Z,CONTRIBUTOR,True,61,3,1,"Rust crate for wrapping the Janus C plugin API, so you can build Janus plugins in Rust.",Rust,ecd9f76ca8c6cdc96f11792114c9556352401cb6,Add tests for log colored output

I noticed that log messages don't get colored.

After spending some time I found that it is mainly because of how we generate output string.
We use `push_str` which requires `&str` as a parameter. So, we have to use `&` and dereference occurs on `ColoredString` instance.

Due to [implementation](https://github.com/mackwic/colored/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L194) of `Deref` for `ColoredString` only  raw text gets returned (without any style attributes).

I tried to use `write!` and it worked.
I also decided to change another `push_str` usages to `write!` for consistency.

What do you think?
