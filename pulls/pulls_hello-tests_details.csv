26,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/hello-tests/pulls/10,10,Fix an intermittent failure for the title not being visible - wait for the element to be visible before moving on.,"We've seen a couple of intermittent failures recently:

_____________________ TestHelloPage.test_supported_browser _____________________
tests/test_hello.py:17: in test_supported_browser
    assert hello_page.is_header_title_visible
E   assert <pages.hello.HelloPage object at 0x7f6044b34950>.is_header_title_visible

I think this is due to the fact that there's now a intermediate display (of nothing) on load where we might not display the logo & title straight away.

The best way to handle this seems to be to add a wait before returning the element.

One of the Hello tests failed yesterday and I noticed that the failure message was not helpful in debugging the issue because it was using `Assert.equal`. I decided to replace `unittestzero` with native `assert`s as we have said we would do with all of our projects.

Also, in speaking to Standard8 it was decided we should run these tests in dev, so I updated the jobs and also changed the default `baseurl` in `mozwebqa.cfg`. I did that in a separate commit, but it's included in this PR.
