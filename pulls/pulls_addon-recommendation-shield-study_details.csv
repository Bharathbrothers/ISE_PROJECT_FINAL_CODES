3,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/addon-recommendation-shield-study/pulls/92,92,Refactoring of onboarding code (better fix for #91),"There are several methods that rely on the simple pref that marks the onboarding as complete. #91 alters the way the simple pref is used, which causes several issues. This commit fixes the issue that #91 fixes, but in a way which does not break the methods that depend specific usage of the onboarding pref.

The key change is that the tabs event listener that calls the endOnboard method is now the onOpen listener, rather than the onReady. onOpen fires immediately when the tab opens, while onReady fires once the page is completely loaded. Use of onReady contributed to the repeated onboarding events some users expirienced, as closing the tab before it loads completely would mean the onboarding complete pref was never set to true.

Testing using the same procedures as #91, namely simulating a 100% loss network on my computer and installing the addon on a fresh firefox build (to test closing the onboarding tab before it fully loads), showed that this commit fixes the issue of repeated onboarding events. Additionally, the methods that rely on the onboarding pref are not broken in this commit, as the usage of the pref is returned to the way it was previously.

I'm using simple prefs to note that the onboarding event (where wikipedia is opened) has occurred. Previously the pref was set after the page had fully loaded, meaning that if users closed the wikipedia tab early (on a slow internet connection), the onboarding event would not be marked as complete. Therefore I've moved the pref set to as soon as the onboard method is called, eliminating this race condition.

I replicated the issue by simulating a very slow internet connection on my computer and testing the addon. This PR fixes the issue in my testing."

I didn't think that this was why though.

I made some adjustments to it a while ago, not knowing that I should have used border box. I've now brought the original verison of _installButton from the disco page back in.
