  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.8.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `3286 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3286&gt;`_: ``.pytest_cache`` directory is now automatically ignored by Git. Users who would like to contribute a solution for other SCMs please consult/comment on this issue.


- `3749 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3749&gt;`_: Fix the following error during collection of tests inside packages::

      TypeError: object of type &#39;Package&#39; has no len()


- `3941 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3941&gt;`_: Fix bug where indirect parametrization would consider the scope of all fixtures used by the test function to determine the parametrization scope, and not only the scope of the fixtures being parametrized.


- `3973 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3973&gt;`_: Fix crash of the assertion rewriter if a test changed the current working directory without restoring it afterwards.


- `3998 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3998&gt;`_: Fix issue that prevented some caplog properties (for example ``record_tuples``) from being available when entering the debugger with ``--pdb``.


- `3999 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3999&gt;`_: Fix ``UnicodeDecodeError`` in python2.x when a class returns a non-ascii binary ``__repr__`` in an assertion which also contains non-ascii text.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `3996 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3996&gt;`_: New `Deprecations and Removals &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html&gt;`_ page shows all currently
  deprecated features, the rationale to do so, and alternatives to update your code. It also list features removed
  from pytest in past major releases to help those with ancient pytest versions to upgrade.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `3955 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3955&gt;`_: Improve pre-commit detection for changelog filenames


- `3975 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3975&gt;`_: Remove legacy code around im_func as that was python2 only
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.8.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- `2452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2452&gt;`_: ``Config.warn`` and ``Node.warn`` have been
  deprecated, see `&lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.htmlconfig-warn-and-node-warn&gt;`_ for rationale and
  examples.

- `3936 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3936&gt;`_: ``pytest.mark.filterwarnings`` second parameter is no longer regex-escaped,
  making it possible to actually use regular expressions to check the warning message.

  **Note**: regex-escaping the match string was an implementation oversight that might break test suites which depend
  on the old behavior.



Features
--------

- `2452 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2452&gt;`_: Internal pytest warnings are now issued using the standard ``warnings`` module, making it possible to use
  the standard warnings filters to manage those warnings. This introduces ``PytestWarning``,
  ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` and ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning types as part of the public API.

  Consult `the documentation &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.htmlinternal-pytest-warnings&gt;`_ for more info.


- `2908 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2908&gt;`_: ``DeprecationWarning`` and ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are now shown by default if no other warning filter is
  configured. This makes pytest more compliant with
  `PEP-0506 &lt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0565/recommended-filter-settings-for-test-runners&gt;`_. See
  `the docs &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.htmldeprecationwarning-and-pendingdeprecationwarning&gt;`_ for
  more info.


- `3251 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3251&gt;`_: Warnings are now captured and displayed during test collection.


- `3784 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3784&gt;`_: ``PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD`` environment variable disables plugin auto-loading when set.


- `3829 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3829&gt;`_: Added the ``count`` option to ``console_output_style`` to enable displaying the progress as a count instead of a percentage.


- `3837 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3837&gt;`_: Added support for &#39;xfailed&#39; and &#39;xpassed&#39; outcomes to the ``pytester.RunResult.assert_outcomes`` signature.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `3911 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3911&gt;`_: Terminal writer now takes into account unicode character width when writing out progress.


- `3913 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3913&gt;`_: Pytest now returns with correct exit code (EXIT_USAGEERROR, 4) when called with unknown arguments.


- `3918 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3918&gt;`_: Improve performance of assertion rewriting.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `3566 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3566&gt;`_: Added a blurb in usage.rst for the usage of -r flag which is used to show an extra test summary info.


- `3907 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3907&gt;`_: Corrected type of the exceptions collection passed to ``xfail``: ``raises`` argument accepts a ``tuple`` instead of ``list``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `3853 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3853&gt;`_: Removed ``&quot;run all (no recorded failures)&quot;`` message printed with ``--failed-first`` and ``--last-failed`` when there are no failed tests.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.7.4
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `3506 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3506&gt;`_: Fix possible infinite recursion when writing ``.pyc`` files.


- `3853 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3853&gt;`_: Cache plugin now obeys the ``-q`` flag when ``--last-failed`` and ``--failed-first`` flags are used.


- `3883 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3883&gt;`_: Fix bad console output when using ``console_output_style=classic``.


- `3888 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3888&gt;`_: Fix macOS specific code using ``capturemanager`` plugin in doctests.



Improved Documentation

   ### 3.7.1
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `3473 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3473&gt;`_: Raise immediately if ``approx()`` is given an expected value of a type it doesn&#39;t understand (e.g. strings, nested dicts, etc.).


- `3712 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3712&gt;`_: Correctly represent the dimensions of an numpy array when calling ``repr()`` on ``approx()``.

- `3742 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3742&gt;`_: Fix incompatibility with third party plugins during collection, which produced the error ``object has no attribute &#39;_collectfile&#39;``.

- `3745 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3745&gt;`_: Display the absolute path if ``cache_dir`` is not relative to the ``rootdir`` instead of failing.


- `3747 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3747&gt;`_: Fix compatibility problem with plugins and the warning code issued by fixture functions when they are called directly.


- `3748 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3748&gt;`_: Fix infinite recursion in ``pytest.approx`` with arrays in ``numpy&lt;1.13``.


- `3757 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3757&gt;`_: Pin pathlib2 to ``&gt;=2.2.0`` as we require ``__fspath__`` support.


- `3763 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3763&gt;`_: Fix ``TypeError`` when the assertion message is ``bytes`` in python 3.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.7.0
   ```
   =========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- `2639 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2639&gt;`_: ``pytest_namespace`` has been deprecated.

  See the documentation for ``pytest_namespace`` hook for suggestions on how to deal
  with this in plugins which use this functionality.


- `3661 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3661&gt;`_: Calling a fixture function directly, as opposed to request them in a test function, now issues a ``RemovedInPytest4Warning``. It will be changed into an error in pytest ``4.0``.

  This is a great source of confusion to new users, which will often call the fixture functions and request them from test functions interchangeably, which breaks the fixture resolution model.



Features
--------

- `2283 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2283&gt;`_: New ``package`` fixture scope: fixtures are finalized when the last test of a *package* finishes. This feature is considered **experimental**, so use it sparingly.


- `3576 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3576&gt;`_: ``Node.add_marker`` now supports an ``append=True/False`` parameter to determine whether the mark comes last (default) or first.


- `3579 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3579&gt;`_: Fixture ``caplog`` now has a ``messages`` property, providing convenient access to the format-interpolated log messages without the extra data provided by the formatter/handler.


- `3610 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3610&gt;`_: New ``--trace`` option to enter the debugger at the start of a test.


- `3623 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3623&gt;`_: Introduce ``pytester.copy_example`` as helper to do acceptance tests against examples from the project.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `2220 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2220&gt;`_: Fix a bug where fixtures overridden by direct parameters (for example parametrization) were being instantiated even if they were not being used by a test.


- `3695 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3695&gt;`_: Fix ``ApproxNumpy`` initialisation argument mixup, ``abs`` and ``rel`` tolerances were flipped causing strange comparsion results.
  Add tests to check ``abs`` and ``rel`` tolerances for ``np.array`` and test for expecting ``nan`` with ``np.array()``


- `980 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/980&gt;`_: Fix truncated locals output in verbose mode.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `3295 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3295&gt;`_: Correct the usage documentation of ``--last-failed-no-failures`` by adding the missing ``--last-failed`` argument in the presented examples, because they are misleading and lead to think that the missing argument is not needed.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `3519 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3519&gt;`_: Now a ``README.md`` file is created in ``.pytest_cache`` to make it clear why the directory exists.
   ```
   
  
  
   ### 3.6.4
   ```
   =========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Invoke pytest using ``-mpytest`` so ``sys.path`` does not get polluted by packages installed in ``site-packages``. (`742 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/742&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Use ``smtp_connection`` instead of ``smtp`` in fixtures documentation to avoid possible confusion. (`3592 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3592&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Remove obsolete ``__future__`` imports. (`2319 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2319&gt;`_)

- Add CITATION to provide information on how to formally cite pytest. (`3402 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3402&gt;`_)

- Replace broken type annotations with type comments. (`3635 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3635&gt;`_)

- Pin ``pluggy`` to ``&lt;0.8``. (`3727 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3727&gt;`_)

   ### 2.19.0
   ```
   ++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Warn user about possible slowdown when using cryptography version &lt; 1.3.4
- Check for invalid host in proxy URL, before forwarding request to adapter.
- Fragments are now properly maintained across redirects. (RFC7231 7.1.2)

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 3.6.0
   ```
   =========================

Features
--------

- Revamp the internals of the ``pytest.mark`` implementation with correct per
  node handling which fixes a number of long standing bugs caused by the old
  design. This introduces new ``Node.iter_markers(name)`` and
  ``Node.get_closest_mark(name)`` APIs. Users are **strongly encouraged** to
  read the `reasons for the revamp in the docs
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.htmlmarker-revamp-and-iteration&gt;`_,
  or jump over to details about `updating existing code to use the new APIs
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.htmlupdating-code&gt;`_. (`3317
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3317&gt;`_)

- Now when ``pytest.fixture`` is applied more than once to the same function a
  ``ValueError`` is raised. This buggy behavior would cause surprising problems
  and if was working for a test suite it was mostly by accident. (`2334
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2334&gt;`_)

- Support for Python 3.7&#39;s builtin ``breakpoint()`` method, see `Using the
  builtin breakpoint function
  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.htmlbreakpoint-builtin&gt;`_ for
  details. (`3180 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3180&gt;`_)

- ``monkeypatch`` now supports a ``context()`` function which acts as a context
  manager which undoes all patching done within the ``with`` block. (`3290
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3290&gt;`_)

- The ``--pdb`` option now causes KeyboardInterrupt to enter the debugger,
  instead of stopping the test session. On python 2.7, hitting CTRL+C again
  exits the debugger. On python 3.2 and higher, use CTRL+D. (`3299
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3299&gt;`_)

- pytest not longer changes the log level of the root logger when the
  ``log-level`` parameter has greater numeric value than that of the level of
  the root logger, which makes it play better with custom logging configuration
  in user code. (`3307 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3307&gt;`_)


Bug Fixes
---------

- A rare race-condition which might result in corrupted ``.pyc`` files on
  Windows has been hopefully solved. (`3008
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3008&gt;`_)

- Also use iter_marker for discovering the marks applying for marker
  expressions from the cli to avoid the bad data from the legacy mark storage.
  (`3441 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3441&gt;`_)

- When showing diffs of failed assertions where the contents contain only
  whitespace, escape them using ``repr()`` first to make it easy to spot the
  differences. (`3443 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3443&gt;`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Change documentation copyright year to a range which auto-updates itself each
  time it is published. (`3303
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3303&gt;`_)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- ``pytest`` now depends on the `python-atomicwrites
  &lt;https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites&gt;`_ library. (`3008
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3008&gt;`_)

- Update all pypi.python.org URLs to pypi.org. (`3431
  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3431&gt;`_)

- Detect `pytest_` prefixed hooks using the internal plugin manager since
  ``pluggy`` is deprecating the ``implprefix`` argument to ``PluginManager``.
  (`3487 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3487&gt;`_)

- Import ``Mapping`` and ``Sequence`` from ``_pytest.compat`` instead of
  directly from ``collections`` in ``python_api.py::approx``. Add ``Mapping``
  to ``_pytest.compat``, import it from ``collections`` on python 2, but from
  ``collections.abc`` on Python 3 to avoid a ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python
  3.7 or newer. (`3497 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3497&gt;`_)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.4.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Move import of ``doctest.UnexpectedException`` to top-level to avoid possible
>  errors when using ``--pdb``. (`1810
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1810&gt;`_)

>- Added printing of captured stdout/stderr before entering pdb, and improved a
>  test which was giving false negatives about output capturing. (`3052
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3052&gt;`_)

>- Fix ordering of tests using parametrized fixtures which can lead to fixtures
>  being created more than necessary. (`3161
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3161&gt;`_)

>- Fix bug where logging happening at hooks outside of &quot;test run&quot; hooks would
>  cause an internal error. (`3184
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3184&gt;`_)

>- Detect arguments injected by ``unittest.mock.patch`` decorator correctly when
>  pypi ``mock.patch`` is installed and imported. (`3206
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3206&gt;`_)

>- Errors shown when a ``pytest.raises()`` with ``match=`` fails are now cleaner
>  on what happened: When no exception was raised, the &quot;matching &#39;...&#39;&quot; part got
>  removed as it falsely implies that an exception was raised but it didn&#39;t
>  match. When a wrong exception was raised, it&#39;s now thrown (like
>  ``pytest.raised()`` without ``match=`` would) instead of complaining about
>  the unmatched text. (`3222
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3222&gt;`_)

>- Fixed output capture handling in doctests on macOS. (`985
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/985&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Add Sphinx parameter docs for ``match`` and ``message`` args to
>  ``pytest.raises``. (`3202
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3202&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- pytest has changed the publication procedure and is now being published to
>  PyPI directly from Travis. (`3060
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3060&gt;`_)

>- Rename ``ParameterSet._for_parameterize()`` to ``_for_parametrize()`` in
>  order to comply with the naming convention. (`3166
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3166&gt;`_)

>- Skip failing pdb/doctest test on mac. (`985
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/985&gt;`_)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.4.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- All pytest classes now subclass ``object`` for better Python 2/3 compatibility.
>  This should not affect user code except in very rare edge cases. (`2147
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147&gt;`_)


>Features
>--------

>- Introduce ``empty_parameter_set_mark`` ini option to select which mark to
>  apply when ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` is given an empty set of parameters.
>  Valid options are ``skip`` (default) and ``xfail``. Note that it is planned
>  to change the default to ``xfail`` in future releases as this is considered
>  less error prone. (`2527
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2527&gt;`_)

>- **Incompatible change**: after community feedback the `logging
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_ functionality has
>  undergone some changes. Please consult the `logging documentation
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.htmlincompatible-changes-in-pytest-3-4&gt;`_
>  for details. (`3013 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3013&gt;`_)

>- Console output falls back to &quot;classic&quot; mode when capturing is disabled (``-s``),
>  otherwise the output gets garbled to the point of being useless. (`3038
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3038&gt;`_)

>- New `pytest_runtest_logfinish
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_logfinish&gt;`_
>  hook which is called when a test item has finished executing, analogous to
>  `pytest_runtest_logstart
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html_pytest.hookspec.pytest_runtest_start&gt;`_.
>  (`3101 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3101&gt;`_)

>- Improve performance when collecting tests using many fixtures. (`3107
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3107&gt;`_)

>- New ``caplog.get_records(when)`` method which provides access to the captured
>  records for the ``&quot;setup&quot;``, ``&quot;call&quot;`` and ``&quot;teardown&quot;``
>  testing stages. (`3117 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3117&gt;`_)

>- New fixture ``record_xml_attribute`` that allows modifying and inserting
>  attributes on the ``&lt;testcase&gt;`` xml node in JUnit reports. (`3130
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3130&gt;`_)

>- The default cache directory has been renamed from ``.cache`` to
>  ``.pytest_cache`` after community feedback that the name ``.cache`` did not
>  make it clear that it was used by pytest. (`3138
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3138&gt;`_)

>- Colorize the levelname column in the live-log output. (`3142
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3142&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix hanging pexpect test on MacOS by using flush() instead of wait().
>  (`2022 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2022&gt;`_)

>- Fix restoring Python state after in-process pytest runs with the
>  ``pytester`` plugin; this may break tests using multiple inprocess
>  pytest runs if later ones depend on earlier ones leaking global interpreter
>  changes. (`3016 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3016&gt;`_)

>- Fix skipping plugin reporting hook when test aborted before plugin setup
>  hook. (`3074 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3074&gt;`_)

>- Fix progress percentage reported when tests fail during teardown. (`3088
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3088&gt;`_)

>- **Incompatible change**: ``-o/--override`` option no longer eats all the
>  remaining options, which can lead to surprising behavior: for example,
>  ``pytest -o foo=1 /path/to/test.py`` would fail because ``/path/to/test.py``
>  would be considered as part of the ``-o`` command-line argument. One
>  consequence of this is that now multiple configuration overrides need
>  multiple ``-o`` flags: ``pytest -o foo=1 -o bar=2``. (`3103
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3103&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Document hooks (defined with ``historic=True``) which cannot be used with
>  ``hookwrapper=True``. (`2423
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2423&gt;`_)

>- Clarify that warning capturing doesn&#39;t change the warning filter by default.
>  (`2457 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2457&gt;`_)

>- Clarify a possible confusion when using pytest_fixture_setup with fixture
>  functions that return None. (`2698
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2698&gt;`_)

>- Fix the wording of a sentence on doctest flags used in pytest. (`3076
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3076&gt;`_)

>- Prefer ``https://*.readthedocs.io`` over ``http://*.rtfd.org`` for links in
>  the documentation. (`3092
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3092&gt;`_)

>- Improve readability (wording, grammar) of Getting Started guide (`3131
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3131&gt;`_)

>- Added note that calling pytest.main multiple times from the same process is
>  not recommended because of import caching. (`3143
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3143&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Show a simple and easy error when keyword expressions trigger a syntax error
>  (for example, ``&quot;-k foo and import&quot;`` will show an error that you can not use
>  the ``import`` keyword in expressions). (`2953
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2953&gt;`_)

>- Change parametrized automatic test id generation to use the ``__name__``
>  attribute of functions instead of the fallback argument name plus counter.
>  (`2976 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2976&gt;`_)

>- Replace py.std with stdlib imports. (`3067
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3067&gt;`_)

>- Corrected &#39;you&#39; to &#39;your&#39; in logging docs. (`3129
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3129&gt;`_)




>### 3.3.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytester: ignore files used to obtain current user metadata in the fd leak
>  detector. (`2784 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2784&gt;`_)

>- Fix **memory leak** where objects returned by fixtures were never destructed
>  by the garbage collector. (`2981
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2981&gt;`_)

>- Fix conversion of pyargs to filename to not convert symlinks on Python 2. (`2985
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2985&gt;`_)

>- ``PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE`` is now checked for plugins too rather than only for
>  test modules. (`2995 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2995&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Add clarifying note about behavior of multiple parametrized arguments (`3001
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3001&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Code cleanup. (`3015 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3015&gt;`_,
>  `3021 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3021&gt;`_)

>- Clean up code by replacing imports and references of `_ast` to `ast`. (`3018

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.3.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions
>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on
>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we
>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users
>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)

>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the
>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2236
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2236&gt;`_)

>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken
>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal
>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)

>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack
>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)

>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it
>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>Features
>--------

>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``
>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available
>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and
>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``
>  declarations on functions. (`2267
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)

>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)

>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The
>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``
>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)

>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)

>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.
>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options
>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using
>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test
>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).
>  For more information, please see the `logging docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was
>  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog
>  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch
>  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the
>  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has
>  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)

>- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the
>  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)

>- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)

>- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and
>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2923
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2923&gt;`_)

>- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from
>  ``readouterr()``. (`2934
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2934&gt;`_)

>- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with
>  ``--doctest-modules``. (`502
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/502&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.
>  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)

>- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now
>  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)

>- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the
>  original traceback. In python2 it will show the original traceback with a new
>  message that explains in which plugin. In python3 it will show 2 canonized
>  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an
>  exception that PyTest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)

>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)

>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to
>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)

>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its
>  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``
>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and
>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)

>- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being
>  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,
>  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation
>  for safety. (`2809 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2809&gt;`_)

>- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from
>  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (`2845
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2845&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which
>  should not be rewritten. (`2939
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2939&gt;`_)

>- Handle marks without description in ``pytest.ini``. (`2942
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2942&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- pytest now depends on `attrs &lt;https://pypi.org/project/attrs/&gt;`_ for internal
>  structures to ease code maintainability. (`2641
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2641&gt;`_)

>- Refactored internal Python 2/3 compatibility code to use ``six``. (`2642
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2642&gt;`_)

>- Stop vendoring ``pluggy`` - we&#39;re missing out on its latest changes for not
>  much benefit (`2719 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2719&gt;`_)

>- Internal refactor: simplify ascii string escaping by using the
>  backslashreplace error handler in newer Python 3 versions. (`2734
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2734&gt;`_)

>- Remove unnecessary mark evaluator in unittest plugin (`2767
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)

>- Calls to ``Metafunc.addcall`` now emit a deprecation warning. This function
>  is scheduled to be removed in ``pytest-4.0``. (`2876
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2876&gt;`_)

>- Internal move of the parameterset extraction to a more maintainable place.
>  (`2877 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2877&gt;`_)

>- Internal refactoring to simplify scope node lookup. (`2910
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2910&gt;`_)

>- Configure ``pytest`` to prevent pip from installing pytest in unsupported
>  Python versions. (`2922
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2922&gt;`_)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.1.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Required options added via ``pytest_addoption`` will no longer prevent using
>  --help without passing them. (1999)

>- Respect ``python_files`` in assertion rewriting. (2121)

>- Fix recursion error detection when frames in the traceback contain objects
>  that can&#39;t be compared (like ``numpy`` arrays). (2459)

>- ``UnicodeWarning`` is issued from the internal pytest warnings plugin only
>  when the message contains non-ascii unicode (Python 2 only). (2463)

>- Added a workaround for Python 3.6 WindowsConsoleIO breaking due to Pytests&#39;s
>  FDCapture. Other code using console handles might still be affected by the
>  very same issue and might require further workarounds/fixes, i.e. colorama.
>  (2467)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Fix internal API links to ``pluggy`` objects. (2331)

>- Make it clear that ``pytest.xfail`` stops test execution at the calling point
>  and improve overall flow of the ``skipping`` docs. (810)

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.1.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
>  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
>  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
>  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (2430)

>- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (2434)

>- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (2436)

>- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
>  context manager form. (2441)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (2390)

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Improvements**

>- It is now possible to pass ``no_proxy`` as a key to the ``proxies``

>  variable.
>- When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories
>  Requests now raises ``IOError``, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS

>- The behavior of ``SessionRedirectMixin`` was slightly altered.
>  ``resolve_redirects`` will now detect a redirect by calling
>  ``get_redirect_target(response)`` instead of directly
>  querying ``Response.is_redirect`` and ``Response.headers[&#39;location&#39;]``.
>  Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
>- Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have higher
>  resolution on Windows.
>- Added ``win_inet_pton`` as conditional dependency for the ``[socks]`` extra
>  on Windows with Python 2.7.
>- Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
>  check doesn&#39;t use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
>- URLs with schemes that begin with ``http`` but are not ``http`` or ``https``
>  no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

>**Bugfixes**

>- Much improved handling of non-ASCII ``Location`` header values in redirects.
>  Fewer ``UnicodeDecodeError``s are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now
>  correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.
>- If an attempt to ``seek`` file to find out its length fails, we now
>  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.
>- Restricted ``HTTPDigestAuth`` to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX
>  responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
>- Fixed some code that was firing ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python 3.6.
>- The dismayed person emoticon (``/o\\``) no longer has a big head. I&#39;m sure
>  this is what you were all worrying about most.


>**Miscellaneous**

>- Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
>- Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
>- Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
>- Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.

### Changelog
> 
>### 2.13.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Features**

>- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
>  save some memory for users.

>**Miscellaneous**

>- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
>- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.



>### 2.12.5

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
>  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.



>### 2.12.4

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
>  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
>  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.



>### 2.12.3

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
>  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
>  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
>  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
>  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
>  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.



>### 2.12.2

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
>  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
>  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
>  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
>  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
>  but still common hostnames.
>- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
>  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
>- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
>  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
>- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
>- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
>  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
>  ``AttributeError``.

>This is a bug-fix release.

>This will be the last RDFLib release to support python 2.5.

>* The RDF/XML Parser was made stricter, now raises exceptions for
>  illegal repeated node-elements.
>  [363](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/363)

>* The SPARQLUpdateStore now supports non-ascii unicode in update
>  statements
>  [356](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/356)

>  [355](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/360)

>* RDF/XML Serializer now uses parseType=Literal for well-formed XML literals

>* A bug in the manchester OWL syntax was fixed
>  [355](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/355)



>### 4.1

>======================

>This is a new minor version RDFLib, which includes a handful of new features:

>* A TriG parser was added (we already had a serializer) - it is
>  up-to-date wrt. to the newest spec from: http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/

>* The Turtle parser was made up to date wrt. to the latest Turtle spec.

>* Many more tests have been added - RDFLib now has over 2000
>  (passing!) tests. This is mainly thanks to the NT, Turtle, TriG,
>  NQuads and SPARQL test-suites from W3C. This also included many
>  fixes to the nt and nquad parsers.

>* ```ConjunctiveGraph``` and ```Dataset``` now support directly adding/removing
>  quads with ```add/addN/remove``` methods.

>* ```rdfpipe``` command now supports datasets, and reading/writing context
>  sensitive formats.

>* Optional graph-tracking was added to the Store interface, allowing
>  empty graphs to be tracked for Datasets. The DataSet class also saw
>  a general clean-up, see: [309](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/309)

>* After long deprecation, ```BackwardCompatibleGraph``` was removed.

>Minor enhancements/bugs fixed:
>------------------------------

>* Many code samples in the documentation were fixed thanks to PuckCh

>* The new ```IOMemory``` store was optimised a bit

>* ```SPARQL(Update)Store``` has been made more generic.

>* MD5 sums were never reinitialized in ```rdflib.compare```

>* Correct default value for empty prefix in N3
>  [312](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/312)

>* Fixed tests when running in a non UTF-8 locale
>  [344](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/344)

>* Prefix in the original turtle have an impact on SPARQL query
>  resolution
>  [313](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/313)

>* Duplicate BNode IDs from N3 Parser
>  [305](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/305)

>* Use QNames for TriG graph names
>  [330](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/330)

>* \uXXXX escapes in Turtle/N3 were fixed
>  [335](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/335)

>* A way to limit the number of triples retrieved from the
>  ```SPARQLStore``` was added
>  [346](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/346)

>* Dots in localnames in Turtle
>  [345](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/345)
>  [336](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/336)

>* ```BNode``` as Graph&#39;s public ID
>  [300](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/300)

>* Introduced ordering of ```QuotedGraphs```
>  [291](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/291)



>### 4.0.1

>========================

>Following RDFLib tradition, some bugs snuck into the 4.0 release.
>This is a bug-fixing release:

>* the new URI validation caused lots of problems, but is
>  nescessary to avoid &#39;&#39;RDF injection&#39;&#39; vulnerabilities. In the
>  spirit of &#39;&#39;be liberal in what you accept, but conservative in
>  what you produce&quot;, we moved validation to serialisation time.

>* the   ```rdflib.tools```   package    was   missing   from   the
>  ```setup.py```  script, and  was therefore  not included  in the
>  PYPI tarballs.

>* RDF parser choked on empty namespace URI
>  [288](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/288)

>* Parsing from ```sys.stdin``` was broken
>  [285](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/285)

>* The new IO store had problems with concurrent modifications if
>  several graphs used the same store
>  [286](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/286)

>* Moved HTML5Lib dependency to the recently released 1.0b1 which
>  support python3



>### 4.0

>======================

>This release includes several major changes:

>* The new SPARQL 1.1 engine (rdflib-sparql) has been included in
>  the core distribution. SPARQL 1.1 queries and updates should
>  work out of the box.

>  * SPARQL paths are exposed as operators on ```URIRefs```, these can
>    then be be used with graph.triples and friends:

>    ```py
>     List names of friends of Bob:
>    g.triples(( bob, FOAF.knows/FOAF.name , None ))

>     All super-classes:
>    g.triples(( cls, RDFS.subClassOf * &#39;+&#39;, None ))
>    ```

>      * a new ```graph.update``` method will apply SPARQL update statements

>* Several RDF 1.1 features are available:
>  * A new ```DataSet``` class
>  * ```XMLLiteral``` and ```HTMLLiterals```
>  * ```BNode``` (de)skolemization is supported through ```BNode.skolemize```,
>    ```URIRef.de_skolemize```, ```Graph.skolemize``` and ```Graph.de_skolemize```

>* Handled of Literal equality was split into lexical comparison
>  (for normal ```==``` operator) and value space (using new ```Node.eq```
>  methods). This introduces some slight backwards incomaptible
>  changes, but was necessary, as the old version had
>  inconsisten hash and equality methods that could lead the
>  literals not working correctly in dicts/sets.
>  The new way is more in line with how SPARQL 1.1 works.
>  For the full details, see:

>  https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/wiki/Literal-reworking

>* Iterating over ```QueryResults``` will generate ```ResultRow``` objects,
>  these allow access to variable bindings as attributes or as a
>  dict. I.e.

>  ```py
>  for row in graph.query(&#39;select ... &#39;) :
>     print row.age, row[&quot;name&quot;]
>  ```

>* &quot;Slicing&quot; of Graphs and Resources as syntactic sugar:
>  ([271](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/271))

>  ```py
>  graph[bob : FOAF.knows/FOAF.name]
>            -&gt; generator over the names of Bobs friends
>  ```

>* The ```SPARQLStore``` and ```SPARQLUpdateStore``` are now included
>  in the RDFLib core

>* The documentation has been given a major overhaul, and examples
>  for most features have been added.


>Minor Changes:
>--------------

>* String operations on URIRefs return new URIRefs: ([258](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/258))
>  ```py
>  &gt;&gt;&gt; URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/&#39;)+&#39;test
>  rdflib.term.URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/test&#39;)
>  ```

>* Parser/Serializer plugins are also found by mime-type, not just
>  by plugin name:  ([277](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/277))
>* ```Namespace``` is no longer a subclass of ```URIRef```
>* URIRefs and Literal language tags are validated on construction,
>  avoiding some &quot;RDF-injection&quot; issues ([266](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/266))
>* A new memory store needs much less memory when loading large
>  graphs ([268](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/268))
>* Turtle/N3 serializer now supports the base keyword correctly ([248](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/248))
>* py2exe support was fixed ([257](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/257))
>* Several bugs in the TriG serializer were fixed
>* Several bugs in the NQuads parser were fixed

>### 3.0.5

>==================

>* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (`2105`_).
>  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to `mbukatov`_ for the report and
>  `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
>  and filenames, respectively (`2089`_ and `2078`_). Thanks to `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (`478`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (`687`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
>  Thanks to `dupuy`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``&quot;4 +- 4.0e-06&quot;``)
>  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
>  which can result in bugs such as `2111`_. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``±`` (for example ``4 ± 4.0e-06``).
>  Thanks `kerrick-lyft`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
>  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (`2034`_).
>  Thanks `nmundar`_ for the PR.

>* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (`2082`_).
>  Thanks `adler-j`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
>  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
>  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (`2016`_).
>  Thanks `d-b-w`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
>  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
>  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(`2103`_).
>  Thanks `jaraco`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (`2038`_). Thanks
>  `nedbat`_.

>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.
>

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
>  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
>  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks `barneygale`_ for the
>  PR.

>### 3.0.6

>==================

>* pytest no longer generates ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version ``3.0.5`` (`2118`_).
>  Thanks to `nicoddemus`_ for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (`2129`_).
>  Thanks to `malinoff`_ for the PR.

>* Plugins loaded by the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are now automatically
>  considered for assertion rewriting (`2185`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (`2150`_). The type(s) of the
>  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
>  error message. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR.

>* Fix ``pytester`` internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of
>  ``zope.interface`` (`1989`_). Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (`1920`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>### 3.0.5

>==================

>* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (`2105`_).
>  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to `mbukatov`_ for the report and
>  `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
>  and filenames, respectively (`2089`_ and `2078`_). Thanks to `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (`478`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (`687`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
>  Thanks to `dupuy`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``&quot;4 +- 4.0e-06&quot;``)
>  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
>  which can result in bugs such as `2111`_. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``±`` (for example ``4 ± 4.0e-06``).
>  Thanks `kerrick-lyft`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
>  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (`2034`_).
>  Thanks `nmundar`_ for the PR.

>* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (`2082`_).
>  Thanks `adler-j`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
>  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
>  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (`2016`_).
>  Thanks `d-b-w`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
>  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
>  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(`2103`_).
>  Thanks `jaraco`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (`2038`_). Thanks
>  `nedbat`_.

>### 4.1

>======================

>This is a new minor version RDFLib, which includes a handful of new features:

>* A TriG parser was added (we already had a serializer) - it is
>  up-to-date wrt. to the newest spec from: http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/

>* The Turtle parser was made up to date wrt. to the latest Turtle spec.

>* Many more tests have been added - RDFLib now has over 2000
>  (passing!) tests. This is mainly thanks to the NT, Turtle, TriG,
>  NQuads and SPARQL test-suites from W3C. This also included many
>  fixes to the nt and nquad parsers.

>* ```ConjunctiveGraph``` and ```Dataset``` now support directly adding/removing
>  quads with ```add/addN/remove``` methods.

>* ```rdfpipe``` command now supports datasets, and reading/writing context
>  sensitive formats.

>* Optional graph-tracking was added to the Store interface, allowing
>  empty graphs to be tracked for Datasets. The DataSet class also saw
>  a general clean-up, see: [309](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/309)

>* After long deprecation, ```BackwardCompatibleGraph``` was removed.

>Minor enhancements/bugs fixed:
>------------------------------

>* Many code samples in the documentation were fixed thanks to PuckCh

>* The new ```IOMemory``` store was optimised a bit

>* ```SPARQL(Update)Store``` has been made more generic.

>* MD5 sums were never reinitialized in ```rdflib.compare```

>* Correct default value for empty prefix in N3
>  [312](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/312)

>* Fixed tests when running in a non UTF-8 locale
>  [344](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/344)

>* Prefix in the original turtle have an impact on SPARQL query
>  resolution
>  [313](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/313)

>* Duplicate BNode IDs from N3 Parser
>  [305](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/305)

>* Use QNames for TriG graph names
>  [330](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/330)

>* \uXXXX escapes in Turtle/N3 were fixed
>  [335](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/335)

>* A way to limit the number of triples retrieved from the
>  ```SPARQLStore``` was added
>  [346](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/346)

>* Dots in localnames in Turtle
>  [345](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/345)
>  [336](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/336)

>* ```BNode``` as Graph&#39;s public ID

>* Introduced ordering of ```QuotedGraphs```
>  [291](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/291)



>### 4.0.1

>========================

>Following RDFLib tradition, some bugs snuck into the 4.0 release.
>This is a bug-fixing release:

>* the new URI validation caused lots of problems, but is
>  nescessary to avoid &#39;&#39;RDF injection&#39;&#39; vulnerabilities. In the
>  spirit of &#39;&#39;be liberal in what you accept, but conservative in
>  what you produce&quot;, we moved validation to serialisation time.

>* the   ```rdflib.tools```   package    was   missing   from   the
>  ```setup.py```  script, and  was therefore  not included  in the
>  PYPI tarballs.

>* RDF parser choked on empty namespace URI
>  [288](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/288)

>* Parsing from ```sys.stdin``` was broken
>  [285](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/285)

>* The new IO store had problems with concurrent modifications if
>  several graphs used the same store
>  [286](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/286)

>* Moved HTML5Lib dependency to the recently released 1.0b1 which
>  support python3



>### 4.0

>======================

>This release includes several major changes:

>* The new SPARQL 1.1 engine (rdflib-sparql) has been included in
>  the core distribution. SPARQL 1.1 queries and updates should
>  work out of the box.

>  * SPARQL paths are exposed as operators on ```URIRefs```, these can
>    then be be used with graph.triples and friends:

>    ```py
>     List names of friends of Bob:
>    g.triples(( bob, FOAF.knows/FOAF.name , None ))

>     All super-classes:
>    g.triples(( cls, RDFS.subClassOf * &#39;+&#39;, None ))
>    ```

>      * a new ```graph.update``` method will apply SPARQL update statements

>* Several RDF 1.1 features are available:
>  * A new ```DataSet``` class
>  * ```XMLLiteral``` and ```HTMLLiterals```
>  * ```BNode``` (de)skolemization is supported through ```BNode.skolemize```,
>    ```URIRef.de_skolemize```, ```Graph.skolemize``` and ```Graph.de_skolemize```

>* Handled of Literal equality was split into lexical comparison
>  (for normal ```==``` operator) and value space (using new ```Node.eq```
>  methods). This introduces some slight backwards incomaptible
>  changes, but was necessary, as the old version had
>  inconsisten hash and equality methods that could lead the
>  literals not working correctly in dicts/sets.
>  The new way is more in line with how SPARQL 1.1 works.
>  For the full details, see:

>  https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/wiki/Literal-reworking

>* Iterating over ```QueryResults``` will generate ```ResultRow``` objects,
>  these allow access to variable bindings as attributes or as a
>  dict. I.e.

>  ```py
>  for row in graph.query(&#39;select ... &#39;) :
>     print row.age, row[&quot;name&quot;]
>  ```

>* &quot;Slicing&quot; of Graphs and Resources as syntactic sugar:
>  ([271](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/271))

>  ```py
>  graph[bob : FOAF.knows/FOAF.name]
>            -&gt; generator over the names of Bobs friends
>  ```

>* The ```SPARQLStore``` and ```SPARQLUpdateStore``` are now included
>  in the RDFLib core

>* The documentation has been given a major overhaul, and examples
>  for most features have been added.


>Minor Changes:
>--------------

>* String operations on URIRefs return new URIRefs: ([258](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/258))
>  ```py
>  &gt;&gt;&gt; URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/&#39;)+&#39;test
>  rdflib.term.URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/test&#39;)
>  ```

>* Parser/Serializer plugins are also found by mime-type, not just
>  by plugin name:  ([277](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/277))
>* ```Namespace``` is no longer a subclass of ```URIRef```
>* URIRefs and Literal language tags are validated on construction,
>  avoiding some &quot;RDF-injection&quot; issues ([266](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/266))
>* A new memory store needs much less memory when loading large
>  graphs ([268](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/268))
>* Turtle/N3 serializer now supports the base keyword correctly ([248](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/248))
>* py2exe support was fixed ([257](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/257))
>* Several bugs in the TriG serializer were fixed
>* Several bugs in the NQuads parser were fixed







### requests 2.12.1 -> 2.13.0

>### 2.13.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Features**

>- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
>  save some memory for users.

>**Miscellaneous**

>- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
>- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.



>### 2.12.5

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
>  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.



>### 2.12.4

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
>  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
>  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.



>### 2.12.3

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
>  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
>  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
>  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
>  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
>  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.



>### 2.12.2

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
>  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
>  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
>  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
>  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
>  but still common hostnames.
>- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
>  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
>- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
>  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
>- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
>- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
>  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
>  ``AttributeError``.

### pytest 3.0.4 -> 3.0.7

>### 3.0.7

>==================


>* Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules silently discarding

>  Notably, importing the `anydbm` module is fixed. (`2248`_).
>  Thanks `pfhayes`_ for the PR.

>* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occured twice per testcase
>  element in the XML report. Thanks `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with ``--pdb``
>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.
>  
>* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`2238`_).
>  Thanks `sirex`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to `PEP-479`_ (`2160`_).
>  Thanks `tgoodlet`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
>  
>* Fix internal errors when an unprintable ``AssertionError`` is raised inside a test.
>  Thanks `omerhadari`_ for the PR.

>* Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (`2231`_).
>  Thanks to `vidartf`_.

>* Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (`2281`_). Thanks `fbjorn`_ for the PR.

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
>  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
>  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks `barneygale`_ for the
>  PR.

>### 3.0.6

>==================

>* pytest no longer generates ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version ``3.0.5`` (`2118`_).
>  Thanks to `nicoddemus`_ for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (`2129`_).
>  Thanks to `malinoff`_ for the PR.

>* Plugins loaded by the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are now automatically
>  considered for assertion rewriting (`2185`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (`2150`_). The type(s) of the
>  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
>  error message. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR.

>* Fix ``pytester`` internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of
>  ``zope.interface`` (`1989`_). Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (`1920`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
>  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to `eli-b`_ for the PR.

>### 3.0.5

>==================

>* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (`2105`_).
>  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to `mbukatov`_ for the report and
>  `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
>  and filenames, respectively (`2089`_ and `2078`_). Thanks to `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (`478`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (`687`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
>  Thanks to `dupuy`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``&quot;4 +- 4.0e-06&quot;``)
>  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
>  which can result in bugs such as `2111`_. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``±`` (for example ``4 ± 4.0e-06``).
>  Thanks `kerrick-lyft`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
>  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (`2034`_).
>  Thanks `nmundar`_ for the PR.

>* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (`2082`_).
>  Thanks `adler-j`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
>  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
>  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (`2016`_).
>  Thanks `d-b-w`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
>  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
>  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(`2103`_).
>  Thanks `jaraco`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (`2038`_). Thanks
>  `nedbat`_.

>### 4.1

>======================

>This is a new minor version RDFLib, which includes a handful of new features:

>* A TriG parser was added (we already had a serializer) - it is
>  up-to-date wrt. to the newest spec from: http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/

>* The Turtle parser was made up to date wrt. to the latest Turtle spec.

>* Many more tests have been added - RDFLib now has over 2000
>  (passing!) tests. This is mainly thanks to the NT, Turtle, TriG,
>  NQuads and SPARQL test-suites from W3C. This also included many
>  fixes to the nt and nquad parsers.

>* ```ConjunctiveGraph``` and ```Dataset``` now support directly adding/removing
>  quads with ```add/addN/remove``` methods.

>* ```rdfpipe``` command now supports datasets, and reading/writing context
>  sensitive formats.

>* Optional graph-tracking was added to the Store interface, allowing
>  empty graphs to be tracked for Datasets. The DataSet class also saw
>  a general clean-up, see: [309](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/309)

>* After long deprecation, ```BackwardCompatibleGraph``` was removed.

>Minor enhancements/bugs fixed:
>------------------------------

>* Many code samples in the documentation were fixed thanks to PuckCh

>* The new ```IOMemory``` store was optimised a bit

>* ```SPARQL(Update)Store``` has been made more generic.

>* MD5 sums were never reinitialized in ```rdflib.compare```

>* Correct default value for empty prefix in N3
>  [312](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/312)

>* Fixed tests when running in a non UTF-8 locale
>  [344](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/344)

>* Prefix in the original turtle have an impact on SPARQL query
>  resolution
>  [313](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/313)

>* Duplicate BNode IDs from N3 Parser
>  [305](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/305)

>* Use QNames for TriG graph names
>  [330](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/330)

>* \uXXXX escapes in Turtle/N3 were fixed
>  [335](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/335)

>* A way to limit the number of triples retrieved from the
>  ```SPARQLStore``` was added
>  [346](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/346)

>* Dots in localnames in Turtle
>  [345](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/345)
>  [336](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/336)

>* ```BNode``` as Graph&#39;s public ID
>  [300](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/300)

>* Introduced ordering of ```QuotedGraphs```
>  [291](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/291)



>### 4.0.1

>========================

>Following RDFLib tradition, some bugs snuck into the 4.0 release.
>This is a bug-fixing release:

>* the new URI validation caused lots of problems, but is
>  nescessary to avoid &#39;&#39;RDF injection&#39;&#39; vulnerabilities. In the
>  spirit of &#39;&#39;be liberal in what you accept, but conservative in
>  what you produce&quot;, we moved validation to serialisation time.

>* the   ```rdflib.tools```   package    was   missing   from   the
>  ```setup.py```  script, and  was therefore  not included  in the
>  PYPI tarballs.

>* RDF parser choked on empty namespace URI
>  [288](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/288)

>* Parsing from ```sys.stdin``` was broken
>  [285](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/285)

>* The new IO store had problems with concurrent modifications if
>  several graphs used the same store
>  [286](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/286)

>* Moved HTML5Lib dependency to the recently released 1.0b1 which
>  support python3



>### 4.0

>======================

>This release includes several major changes:

>* The new SPARQL 1.1 engine (rdflib-sparql) has been included in
>  the core distribution. SPARQL 1.1 queries and updates should
>  work out of the box.

>  * SPARQL paths are exposed as operators on ```URIRefs```, these can
>    then be be used with graph.triples and friends:

>    ```py
>     List names of friends of Bob:
>    g.triples(( bob, FOAF.knows/FOAF.name , None ))

>     All super-classes:
>    g.triples(( cls, RDFS.subClassOf * &#39;+&#39;, None ))
>    ```

>      * a new ```graph.update``` method will apply SPARQL update statements

>* Several RDF 1.1 features are available:
>  * A new ```DataSet``` class
>  * ```XMLLiteral``` and ```HTMLLiterals```
>  * ```BNode``` (de)skolemization is supported through ```BNode.skolemize```,
>    ```URIRef.de_skolemize```, ```Graph.skolemize``` and ```Graph.de_skolemize```

>* Handled of Literal equality was split into lexical comparison
>  (for normal ```==``` operator) and value space (using new ```Node.eq```
>  methods). This introduces some slight backwards incomaptible
>  changes, but was necessary, as the old version had
>  inconsisten hash and equality methods that could lead the
>  literals not working correctly in dicts/sets.
>  The new way is more in line with how SPARQL 1.1 works.
>  For the full details, see:

>  https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/wiki/Literal-reworking

>* Iterating over ```QueryResults``` will generate ```ResultRow``` objects,
>  these allow access to variable bindings as attributes or as a
>  dict. I.e.

>  ```py
>  for row in graph.query(&#39;select ... &#39;) :
>     print row.age, row[&quot;name&quot;]
>  ```

>* &quot;Slicing&quot; of Graphs and Resources as syntactic sugar:
>  ([271](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/271))

>  ```py
>  graph[bob : FOAF.knows/FOAF.name]
>            -&gt; generator over the names of Bobs friends
>  ```

>* The ```SPARQLStore``` and ```SPARQLUpdateStore``` are now included
>  in the RDFLib core

>* The documentation has been given a major overhaul, and examples
>  for most features have been added.


>Minor Changes:
>--------------

>* String operations on URIRefs return new URIRefs: ([258](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/258))
>  ```py
>  &gt;&gt;&gt; URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/&#39;)+&#39;test
>  rdflib.term.URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/test&#39;)
>  ```

>* Parser/Serializer plugins are also found by mime-type, not just
>  by plugin name:  ([277](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/277))
>* ```Namespace``` is no longer a subclass of ```URIRef```
>* URIRefs and Literal language tags are validated on construction,
>  avoiding some &quot;RDF-injection&quot; issues ([266](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/266))
>* A new memory store needs much less memory when loading large
>  graphs ([268](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/268))
>* Turtle/N3 serializer now supports the base keyword correctly ([248](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/248))
>* py2exe support was fixed ([257](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/257))
>* Several bugs in the TriG serializer were fixed
>* Several bugs in the NQuads parser were fixed







### requests 2.12.1 -> 2.13.0

>### 2.13.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Features**

>- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
>  save some memory for users.

>**Miscellaneous**

>- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
>- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.



>### 2.12.5

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
>  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.



>### 2.12.4

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
>  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
>  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.



>### 2.12.3

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
>  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
>  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
>  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
>  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
>  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.



>### 2.12.2

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
>  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
>  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
>  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
>  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
>  but still common hostnames.
>- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
>  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
>- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
>  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
>- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
>- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
>  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
>  ``AttributeError``.

>  Notably, importing the `anydbm` module is fixed. (`2248`_).
>  Thanks `pfhayes`_ for the PR.

>* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occured twice per testcase
>  element in the XML report. Thanks `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with ``--pdb``
>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.
>  
>* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`2238`_).
>  Thanks `sirex`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to `PEP-479`_ (`2160`_).

>  
>* Fix internal errors when an unprintable ``AssertionError`` is raised inside a test.
>  Thanks `omerhadari`_ for the PR.

>* Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (`2231`_).
>  Thanks to `vidartf`_.

>* Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (`2281`_). Thanks `fbjorn`_ for the PR.

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
>  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
>  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks `barneygale`_ for the
>  PR.

>### 3.0.6

>==================

>* pytest no longer generates ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version ``3.0.5`` (`2118`_).
>  Thanks to `nicoddemus`_ for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (`2129`_).
>  Thanks to `malinoff`_ for the PR.

>* Plugins loaded by the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are now automatically
>  considered for assertion rewriting (`2185`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (`2150`_). The type(s) of the
>  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
>  error message. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR.

>* Fix ``pytester`` internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of
>  ``zope.interface`` (`1989`_). Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (`1920`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
>  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to `eli-b`_ for the PR.

>### 3.0.5

>==================

>* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (`2105`_).
>  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to `mbukatov`_ for the report and
>  `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
>  and filenames, respectively (`2089`_ and `2078`_). Thanks to `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (`478`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (`687`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
>  Thanks to `dupuy`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``&quot;4 +- 4.0e-06&quot;``)
>  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
>  which can result in bugs such as `2111`_. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``±`` (for example ``4 ± 4.0e-06``).
>  Thanks `kerrick-lyft`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
>  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (`2034`_).
>  Thanks `nmundar`_ for the PR.

>* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (`2082`_).
>  Thanks `adler-j`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
>  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
>  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (`2016`_).
>  Thanks `d-b-w`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
>  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
>  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(`2103`_).
>  Thanks `jaraco`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (`2038`_). Thanks
>  `nedbat`_.

>### 4.1

>======================

>This is a new minor version RDFLib, which includes a handful of new features:

>* A TriG parser was added (we already had a serializer) - it is
>  up-to-date wrt. to the newest spec from: http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/

>* The Turtle parser was made up to date wrt. to the latest Turtle spec.

>* Many more tests have been added - RDFLib now has over 2000
>  (passing!) tests. This is mainly thanks to the NT, Turtle, TriG,
>  NQuads and SPARQL test-suites from W3C. This also included many
>  fixes to the nt and nquad parsers.

>* ```ConjunctiveGraph``` and ```Dataset``` now support directly adding/removing
>  quads with ```add/addN/remove``` methods.

>* ```rdfpipe``` command now supports datasets, and reading/writing context
>  sensitive formats.

>* Optional graph-tracking was added to the Store interface, allowing
>  empty graphs to be tracked for Datasets. The DataSet class also saw
>  a general clean-up, see: [309](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/309)

>* After long deprecation, ```BackwardCompatibleGraph``` was removed.

>Minor enhancements/bugs fixed:
>------------------------------

>* Many code samples in the documentation were fixed thanks to PuckCh

>* The new ```IOMemory``` store was optimised a bit

>* ```SPARQL(Update)Store``` has been made more generic.

>* MD5 sums were never reinitialized in ```rdflib.compare```

>* Correct default value for empty prefix in N3
>  [312](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/312)

>* Fixed tests when running in a non UTF-8 locale
>  [344](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/344)

>* Prefix in the original turtle have an impact on SPARQL query
>  resolution
>  [313](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/313)

>* Duplicate BNode IDs from N3 Parser
>  [305](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/305)

>* Use QNames for TriG graph names
>  [330](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/330)

>* \uXXXX escapes in Turtle/N3 were fixed
>  [335](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/335)

>* A way to limit the number of triples retrieved from the
>  ```SPARQLStore``` was added
>  [346](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/346)

>* Dots in localnames in Turtle
>  [345](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/345)
>  [336](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/336)

>* ```BNode``` as Graph&#39;s public ID
>  [300](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/300)

>* Introduced ordering of ```QuotedGraphs```
>  [291](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/291)



>### 4.0.1

>========================

>Following RDFLib tradition, some bugs snuck into the 4.0 release.
>This is a bug-fixing release:

>* the new URI validation caused lots of problems, but is
>  nescessary to avoid &#39;&#39;RDF injection&#39;&#39; vulnerabilities. In the
>  spirit of &#39;&#39;be liberal in what you accept, but conservative in
>  what you produce&quot;, we moved validation to serialisation time.

>* the   ```rdflib.tools```   package    was   missing   from   the
>  ```setup.py```  script, and  was therefore  not included  in the
>  PYPI tarballs.

>* RDF parser choked on empty namespace URI
>  [288](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/288)

>* Parsing from ```sys.stdin``` was broken
>  [285](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/285)

>* The new IO store had problems with concurrent modifications if
>  several graphs used the same store
>  [286](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/286)

>* Moved HTML5Lib dependency to the recently released 1.0b1 which
>  support python3



>### 4.0

>======================

>This release includes several major changes:

>* The new SPARQL 1.1 engine (rdflib-sparql) has been included in
>  the core distribution. SPARQL 1.1 queries and updates should
>  work out of the box.

>  * SPARQL paths are exposed as operators on ```URIRefs```, these can
>    then be be used with graph.triples and friends:

>    ```py
>     List names of friends of Bob:
>    g.triples(( bob, FOAF.knows/FOAF.name , None ))

>     All super-classes:
>    g.triples(( cls, RDFS.subClassOf * &#39;+&#39;, None ))
>    ```

>      * a new ```graph.update``` method will apply SPARQL update statements

>* Several RDF 1.1 features are available:
>  * A new ```DataSet``` class
>  * ```XMLLiteral``` and ```HTMLLiterals```
>  * ```BNode``` (de)skolemization is supported through ```BNode.skolemize```,
>    ```URIRef.de_skolemize```, ```Graph.skolemize``` and ```Graph.de_skolemize```

>* Handled of Literal equality was split into lexical comparison
>  (for normal ```==``` operator) and value space (using new ```Node.eq```
>  methods). This introduces some slight backwards incomaptible
>  changes, but was necessary, as the old version had
>  inconsisten hash and equality methods that could lead the
>  literals not working correctly in dicts/sets.
>  The new way is more in line with how SPARQL 1.1 works.
>  For the full details, see:

>  https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/wiki/Literal-reworking

>* Iterating over ```QueryResults``` will generate ```ResultRow``` objects,
>  these allow access to variable bindings as attributes or as a
>  dict. I.e.

>  ```py
>  for row in graph.query(&#39;select ... &#39;) :
>     print row.age, row[&quot;name&quot;]
>  ```

>* &quot;Slicing&quot; of Graphs and Resources as syntactic sugar:
>  ([271](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/271))

>  ```py
>  graph[bob : FOAF.knows/FOAF.name]
>            -&gt; generator over the names of Bobs friends
>  ```

>* The ```SPARQLStore``` and ```SPARQLUpdateStore``` are now included
>  in the RDFLib core

>* The documentation has been given a major overhaul, and examples
>  for most features have been added.


>Minor Changes:
>--------------

>* String operations on URIRefs return new URIRefs: ([258](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/258))
>  ```py
>  &gt;&gt;&gt; URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/&#39;)+&#39;test
>  rdflib.term.URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/test&#39;)
>  ```

>* Parser/Serializer plugins are also found by mime-type, not just
>  by plugin name:  ([277](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/277))
>* ```Namespace``` is no longer a subclass of ```URIRef```
>* URIRefs and Literal language tags are validated on construction,
>  avoiding some &quot;RDF-injection&quot; issues ([266](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/266))
>* A new memory store needs much less memory when loading large
>  graphs ([268](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/268))
>* Turtle/N3 serializer now supports the base keyword correctly ([248](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/248))
>* py2exe support was fixed ([257](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/257))
>* Several bugs in the TriG serializer were fixed
>* Several bugs in the NQuads parser were fixed







### requests 2.12.1 -> 2.13.0

>### 2.13.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Features**

>- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
>  save some memory for users.

>**Miscellaneous**

>- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
>- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.



>### 2.12.5

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
>  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.



>### 2.12.4

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
>  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
>  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.



>### 2.12.3

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
>  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
>  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
>  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
>  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
>  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.



>### 2.12.2

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
>  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
>  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
>  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
>  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
>  but still common hostnames.
>- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
>  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
>- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
>  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
>- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
>- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
>  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
>  ``AttributeError``.

>### 3.0.6

>==================

>* pytest no longer generates ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version ``3.0.5`` (`2118`_).
>  Thanks to `nicoddemus`_ for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (`2129`_).
>  Thanks to `malinoff`_ for the PR.

>* Plugins loaded by the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are now automatically
>  considered for assertion rewriting (`2185`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (`2150`_). The type(s) of the
>  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
>  error message. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR.

>* Fix ``pytester`` internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of
>  ``zope.interface`` (`1989`_). Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (`1920`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
>  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to `eli-b`_ for the PR.

>### 3.0.5

>==================

>* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (`2105`_).
>  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to `mbukatov`_ for the report and
>  `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
>  and filenames, respectively (`2089`_ and `2078`_). Thanks to `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (`478`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (`687`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
>  Thanks to `dupuy`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``&quot;4 +- 4.0e-06&quot;``)
>  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
>  which can result in bugs such as `2111`_. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``±`` (for example ``4 ± 4.0e-06``).
>  Thanks `kerrick-lyft`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
>  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (`2034`_).
>  Thanks `nmundar`_ for the PR.

>* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (`2082`_).
>  Thanks `adler-j`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
>  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
>  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (`2016`_).
>  Thanks `d-b-w`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
>  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
>  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(`2103`_).
>  Thanks `jaraco`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (`2038`_). Thanks
>  `nedbat`_.

>This will be the last RDFLib release to support python 2.5.

>* The RDF/XML Parser was made stricter, now raises exceptions for
>  illegal repeated node-elements.
>  [363](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/363)

>### 4.1

>======================

>This is a new minor version RDFLib, which includes a handful of new features:

>* A TriG parser was added (we already had a serializer) - it is
>  up-to-date wrt. to the newest spec from: http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/

>* The Turtle parser was made up to date wrt. to the latest Turtle spec.

>* Many more tests have been added - RDFLib now has over 2000
>  (passing!) tests. This is mainly thanks to the NT, Turtle, TriG,
>  NQuads and SPARQL test-suites from W3C. This also included many
>  fixes to the nt and nquad parsers.

>* ```ConjunctiveGraph``` and ```Dataset``` now support directly adding/removing
>  quads with ```add/addN/remove``` methods.

>* ```rdfpipe``` command now supports datasets, and reading/writing context
>  sensitive formats.

>* Optional graph-tracking was added to the Store interface, allowing
>  empty graphs to be tracked for Datasets. The DataSet class also saw
>  a general clean-up, see: [309](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/309)

>* After long deprecation, ```BackwardCompatibleGraph``` was removed.

>Minor enhancements/bugs fixed:
>------------------------------

>* Many code samples in the documentation were fixed thanks to PuckCh

>* The new ```IOMemory``` store was optimised a bit

>* ```SPARQL(Update)Store``` has been made more generic.

>* MD5 sums were never reinitialized in ```rdflib.compare```

>* Correct default value for empty prefix in N3
>  [312](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/312)

>* Fixed tests when running in a non UTF-8 locale
>  [344](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/344)

>* Prefix in the original turtle have an impact on SPARQL query
>  resolution
>  [313](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/313)

>* Duplicate BNode IDs from N3 Parser
>  [305](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/305)

>* Use QNames for TriG graph names
>  [330](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/330)

>* \uXXXX escapes in Turtle/N3 were fixed
>  [335](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/335)

>* A way to limit the number of triples retrieved from the
>  ```SPARQLStore``` was added
>  [346](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/346)

>* Dots in localnames in Turtle
>  [345](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/345)
>  [336](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/336)

>* ```BNode``` as Graph&#39;s public ID
>  [300](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/300)

>* Introduced ordering of ```QuotedGraphs```
>  [291](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/291)



>### 4.0.1

>========================

>Following RDFLib tradition, some bugs snuck into the 4.0 release.
>This is a bug-fixing release:

>* the new URI validation caused lots of problems, but is
>  nescessary to avoid &#39;&#39;RDF injection&#39;&#39; vulnerabilities. In the
>  spirit of &#39;&#39;be liberal in what you accept, but conservative in
>  what you produce&quot;, we moved validation to serialisation time.

>* the   ```rdflib.tools```   package    was   missing   from   the
>  ```setup.py```  script, and  was therefore  not included  in the
>  PYPI tarballs.

>* RDF parser choked on empty namespace URI
>  [288](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/288)

>* Parsing from ```sys.stdin``` was broken
>  [285](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/285)

>* The new IO store had problems with concurrent modifications if
>  several graphs used the same store
>  [286](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/286)

>* Moved HTML5Lib dependency to the recently released 1.0b1 which
>  support python3



>### 4.0

>======================

>This release includes several major changes:

>* The new SPARQL 1.1 engine (rdflib-sparql) has been included in
>  the core distribution. SPARQL 1.1 queries and updates should
>  work out of the box.

>  * SPARQL paths are exposed as operators on ```URIRefs```, these can
>    then be be used with graph.triples and friends:

>    ```py
>     List names of friends of Bob:
>    g.triples(( bob, FOAF.knows/FOAF.name , None ))

>     All super-classes:
>    g.triples(( cls, RDFS.subClassOf * &#39;+&#39;, None ))
>    ```

>      * a new ```graph.update``` method will apply SPARQL update statements

>* Several RDF 1.1 features are available:
>  * A new ```DataSet``` class
>  * ```XMLLiteral``` and ```HTMLLiterals```
>  * ```BNode``` (de)skolemization is supported through ```BNode.skolemize```,
>    ```URIRef.de_skolemize```, ```Graph.skolemize``` and ```Graph.de_skolemize```

>* Handled of Literal equality was split into lexical comparison
>  (for normal ```==``` operator) and value space (using new ```Node.eq```
>  methods). This introduces some slight backwards incomaptible
>  changes, but was necessary, as the old version had
>  inconsisten hash and equality methods that could lead the
>  literals not working correctly in dicts/sets.
>  The new way is more in line with how SPARQL 1.1 works.
>  For the full details, see:

>  https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/wiki/Literal-reworking

>* Iterating over ```QueryResults``` will generate ```ResultRow``` objects,
>  these allow access to variable bindings as attributes or as a
>  dict. I.e.

>  ```py
>  for row in graph.query(&#39;select ... &#39;) :
>     print row.age, row[&quot;name&quot;]
>  ```

>* &quot;Slicing&quot; of Graphs and Resources as syntactic sugar:
>  ([271](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/271))

>  ```py
>  graph[bob : FOAF.knows/FOAF.name]
>            -&gt; generator over the names of Bobs friends
>  ```

>* The ```SPARQLStore``` and ```SPARQLUpdateStore``` are now included
>  in the RDFLib core

>* The documentation has been given a major overhaul, and examples
>  for most features have been added.


>Minor Changes:
>--------------

>* String operations on URIRefs return new URIRefs: ([258](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/258))
>  ```py
>  &gt;&gt;&gt; URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/&#39;)+&#39;test
>  rdflib.term.URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/test&#39;)
>  ```

>* Parser/Serializer plugins are also found by mime-type, not just
>  by plugin name:  ([277](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/277))
>* ```Namespace``` is no longer a subclass of ```URIRef```
>* URIRefs and Literal language tags are validated on construction,
>  avoiding some &quot;RDF-injection&quot; issues ([266](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/266))
>* A new memory store needs much less memory when loading large
>  graphs ([268](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/268))
>* Turtle/N3 serializer now supports the base keyword correctly ([248](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/248))
>* py2exe support was fixed ([257](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/257))
>* Several bugs in the TriG serializer were fixed
>* Several bugs in the NQuads parser were fixed







### requests 2.12.1 -> 2.13.0

>### 2.13.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Features**

>- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
>  save some memory for users.

>**Miscellaneous**

>- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
>- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.



>### 2.12.5

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
>  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.



>### 2.12.4

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
>  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
>  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.



>### 2.12.3

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
>  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
>  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
>  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
>  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
>  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.



>### 2.12.2

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
>  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
>  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
>  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
>  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
>  but still common hostnames.
>- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
>  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
>- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
>  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
>- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
>- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
>  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
>  ``AttributeError``.

>### 3.0.6

>==================

>* pytest no longer generates ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version ``3.0.5`` (`2118`_).
>  Thanks to `nicoddemus`_ for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.


>* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (`2129`_).
>  Thanks to `malinoff`_ for the PR.

>* Plugins loaded by the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are now automatically
>  considered for assertion rewriting (`2185`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (`2150`_). The type(s) of the
>  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
>  error message. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR.

>* Fix ``pytester`` internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of
>  ``zope.interface`` (`1989`_). Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (`1920`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
>  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to `eli-b`_ for the PR.

>### 3.0.5

>==================

>* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (`2105`_).
>  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to `mbukatov`_ for the report and
>  `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
>  and filenames, respectively (`2089`_ and `2078`_). Thanks to `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (`478`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (`687`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
>  Thanks to `dupuy`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``&quot;4 +- 4.0e-06&quot;``)
>  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
>  which can result in bugs such as `2111`_. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``±`` (for example ``4 ± 4.0e-06``).
>  Thanks `kerrick-lyft`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
>  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (`2034`_).
>  Thanks `nmundar`_ for the PR.

>* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (`2082`_).
>  Thanks `adler-j`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
>  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
>  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (`2016`_).
>  Thanks `d-b-w`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
>  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
>  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(`2103`_).
>  Thanks `jaraco`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (`2038`_). Thanks
>  `nedbat`_.

>### 4.1

>======================

>This is a new minor version RDFLib, which includes a handful of new features:

>* A TriG parser was added (we already had a serializer) - it is
>  up-to-date wrt. to the newest spec from: http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/

>* The Turtle parser was made up to date wrt. to the latest Turtle spec.

>* Many more tests have been added - RDFLib now has over 2000
>  (passing!) tests. This is mainly thanks to the NT, Turtle, TriG,
>  NQuads and SPARQL test-suites from W3C. This also included many
>  fixes to the nt and nquad parsers.

>* ```ConjunctiveGraph``` and ```Dataset``` now support directly adding/removing
>  quads with ```add/addN/remove``` methods.

>* ```rdfpipe``` command now supports datasets, and reading/writing context
>  sensitive formats.

>* Optional graph-tracking was added to the Store interface, allowing
>  empty graphs to be tracked for Datasets. The DataSet class also saw
>  a general clean-up, see: [309](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/309)

>* After long deprecation, ```BackwardCompatibleGraph``` was removed.

>Minor enhancements/bugs fixed:
>------------------------------

>* Many code samples in the documentation were fixed thanks to PuckCh

>* The new ```IOMemory``` store was optimised a bit

>* ```SPARQL(Update)Store``` has been made more generic.

>* MD5 sums were never reinitialized in ```rdflib.compare```

>* Correct default value for empty prefix in N3
>  [312](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/312)

>* Fixed tests when running in a non UTF-8 locale
>  [344](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/344)

>* Prefix in the original turtle have an impact on SPARQL query
>  resolution
>  [313](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/313)

>* Duplicate BNode IDs from N3 Parser
>  [305](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/305)

>* Use QNames for TriG graph names
>  [330](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/330)

>* \uXXXX escapes in Turtle/N3 were fixed
>  [335](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/335)

>* A way to limit the number of triples retrieved from the
>  ```SPARQLStore``` was added
>  [346](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/346)

>* Dots in localnames in Turtle
>  [345](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/345)
>  [336](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/336)

>* ```BNode``` as Graph&#39;s public ID
>  [300](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/300)

>* Introduced ordering of ```QuotedGraphs```
>  [291](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/291)



>### 4.0.1

>========================

>Following RDFLib tradition, some bugs snuck into the 4.0 release.
>This is a bug-fixing release:

>* the new URI validation caused lots of problems, but is
>  nescessary to avoid &#39;&#39;RDF injection&#39;&#39; vulnerabilities. In the
>  spirit of &#39;&#39;be liberal in what you accept, but conservative in
>  what you produce&quot;, we moved validation to serialisation time.

>* the   ```rdflib.tools```   package    was   missing   from   the
>  ```setup.py```  script, and  was therefore  not included  in the
>  PYPI tarballs.

>* RDF parser choked on empty namespace URI
>  [288](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/288)

>* Parsing from ```sys.stdin``` was broken
>  [285](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/285)

>* The new IO store had problems with concurrent modifications if
>  several graphs used the same store
>  [286](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/286)

>* Moved HTML5Lib dependency to the recently released 1.0b1 which
>  support python3



>### 4.0

>======================

>This release includes several major changes:

>* The new SPARQL 1.1 engine (rdflib-sparql) has been included in
>  the core distribution. SPARQL 1.1 queries and updates should
>  work out of the box.

>  * SPARQL paths are exposed as operators on ```URIRefs```, these can
>    then be be used with graph.triples and friends:

>    ```py
>     List names of friends of Bob:
>    g.triples(( bob, FOAF.knows/FOAF.name , None ))

>     All super-classes:
>    g.triples(( cls, RDFS.subClassOf * &#39;+&#39;, None ))
>    ```

>      * a new ```graph.update``` method will apply SPARQL update statements

>* Several RDF 1.1 features are available:
>  * A new ```DataSet``` class
>  * ```XMLLiteral``` and ```HTMLLiterals```
>  * ```BNode``` (de)skolemization is supported through ```BNode.skolemize```,
>    ```URIRef.de_skolemize```, ```Graph.skolemize``` and ```Graph.de_skolemize```

>* Handled of Literal equality was split into lexical comparison
>  (for normal ```==``` operator) and value space (using new ```Node.eq```
>  methods). This introduces some slight backwards incomaptible
>  changes, but was necessary, as the old version had
>  inconsisten hash and equality methods that could lead the
>  literals not working correctly in dicts/sets.
>  The new way is more in line with how SPARQL 1.1 works.
>  For the full details, see:

>  https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/wiki/Literal-reworking

>* Iterating over ```QueryResults``` will generate ```ResultRow``` objects,
>  these allow access to variable bindings as attributes or as a
>  dict. I.e.

>  ```py
>  for row in graph.query(&#39;select ... &#39;) :
>     print row.age, row[&quot;name&quot;]
>  ```

>* &quot;Slicing&quot; of Graphs and Resources as syntactic sugar:
>  ([271](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/271))

>  ```py
>  graph[bob : FOAF.knows/FOAF.name]
>            -&gt; generator over the names of Bobs friends
>  ```

>* The ```SPARQLStore``` and ```SPARQLUpdateStore``` are now included
>  in the RDFLib core

>* The documentation has been given a major overhaul, and examples
>  for most features have been added.


>Minor Changes:
>--------------

>* String operations on URIRefs return new URIRefs: ([258](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/258))
>  ```py
>  &gt;&gt;&gt; URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/&#39;)+&#39;test
>  rdflib.term.URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/test&#39;)
>  ```

>* Parser/Serializer plugins are also found by mime-type, not just
>  by plugin name:  ([277](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/277))
>* ```Namespace``` is no longer a subclass of ```URIRef```
>* URIRefs and Literal language tags are validated on construction,
>  avoiding some &quot;RDF-injection&quot; issues ([266](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/266))
>* A new memory store needs much less memory when loading large
>  graphs ([268](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/268))
>* Turtle/N3 serializer now supports the base keyword correctly ([248](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/248))
>* py2exe support was fixed ([257](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/257))
>* Several bugs in the TriG serializer were fixed
>* Several bugs in the NQuads parser were fixed







### requests 2.12.1 -> 2.13.0

>### 2.13.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Features**

>- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
>  save some memory for users.

>**Miscellaneous**

>- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
>- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.



>### 2.12.5

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
>  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.



>### 2.12.4

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
>  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
>  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.



>### 2.12.3

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
>  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
>  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
>  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
>  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
>  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.



>### 2.12.2

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
>  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
>  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
>  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
>  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
>  but still common hostnames.
>- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
>  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
>- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
>  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
>- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
>- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
>  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
>  ``AttributeError``.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest

>### 3.0.5

>==================

>* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (`2105`_).
>  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to `mbukatov`_ for the report and
>  `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
>  and filenames, respectively (`2089`_ and `2078`_). Thanks to `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (`478`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (`687`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
>  Thanks to `dupuy`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``&quot;4 +- 4.0e-06&quot;``)
>  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
>  which can result in bugs such as `2111`_. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``±`` (for example ``4 ± 4.0e-06``).
>  Thanks `kerrick-lyft`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
>  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (`2034`_).
>  Thanks `nmundar`_ for the PR.

>* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (`2082`_).
>  Thanks `adler-j`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
>  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
>  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (`2016`_).
>  Thanks `d-b-w`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
>  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
>  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(`2103`_).
>  Thanks `jaraco`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (`2038`_). Thanks
>  `nedbat`_.

>### 4.1

>======================

>This is a new minor version RDFLib, which includes a handful of new features:

>* A TriG parser was added (we already had a serializer) - it is
>  up-to-date wrt. to the newest spec from: http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/

>* The Turtle parser was made up to date wrt. to the latest Turtle spec.

>* Many more tests have been added - RDFLib now has over 2000
>  (passing!) tests. This is mainly thanks to the NT, Turtle, TriG,
>  NQuads and SPARQL test-suites from W3C. This also included many
>  fixes to the nt and nquad parsers.

>* ```ConjunctiveGraph``` and ```Dataset``` now support directly adding/removing
>  quads with ```add/addN/remove``` methods.

>* ```rdfpipe``` command now supports datasets, and reading/writing context
>  sensitive formats.

>* Optional graph-tracking was added to the Store interface, allowing
>  empty graphs to be tracked for Datasets. The DataSet class also saw
>  a general clean-up, see: [309](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/309)

>* After long deprecation, ```BackwardCompatibleGraph``` was removed.

>Minor enhancements/bugs fixed:
>------------------------------

>* Many code samples in the documentation were fixed thanks to PuckCh

>* The new ```IOMemory``` store was optimised a bit

>* ```SPARQL(Update)Store``` has been made more generic.

>* MD5 sums were never reinitialized in ```rdflib.compare```

>* Correct default value for empty prefix in N3
>  [312](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/312)

>* Fixed tests when running in a non UTF-8 locale
>  [344](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/344)

>* Prefix in the original turtle have an impact on SPARQL query
>  resolution
>  [313](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/313)

>* Duplicate BNode IDs from N3 Parser
>  [305](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/305)

>* Use QNames for TriG graph names
>  [330](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/330)

>* \uXXXX escapes in Turtle/N3 were fixed
>  [335](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/335)

>* A way to limit the number of triples retrieved from the
>  ```SPARQLStore``` was added
>  [346](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/346)

>* Dots in localnames in Turtle
>  [345](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/345)
>  [336](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/336)

>* ```BNode``` as Graph&#39;s public ID
>  [300](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/300)

>* Introduced ordering of ```QuotedGraphs```
>  [291](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/291)



>### 4.0.1

>========================

>Following RDFLib tradition, some bugs snuck into the 4.0 release.
>This is a bug-fixing release:

>* the new URI validation caused lots of problems, but is
>  nescessary to avoid &#39;&#39;RDF injection&#39;&#39; vulnerabilities. In the
>  spirit of &#39;&#39;be liberal in what you accept, but conservative in
>  what you produce&quot;, we moved validation to serialisation time.

>* the   ```rdflib.tools```   package    was   missing   from   the
>  ```setup.py```  script, and  was therefore  not included  in the
>  PYPI tarballs.

>* RDF parser choked on empty namespace URI
>  [288](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/288)

>* Parsing from ```sys.stdin``` was broken
>  [285](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/285)

>* The new IO store had problems with concurrent modifications if
>  several graphs used the same store
>  [286](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/286)

>* Moved HTML5Lib dependency to the recently released 1.0b1 which
>  support python3



>### 4.0

>======================

>This release includes several major changes:

>* The new SPARQL 1.1 engine (rdflib-sparql) has been included in
>  the core distribution. SPARQL 1.1 queries and updates should
>  work out of the box.

>  * SPARQL paths are exposed as operators on ```URIRefs```, these can
>    then be be used with graph.triples and friends:

>    ```py
>     List names of friends of Bob:
>    g.triples(( bob, FOAF.knows/FOAF.name , None ))

>     All super-classes:
>    g.triples(( cls, RDFS.subClassOf * &#39;+&#39;, None ))
>    ```

>      * a new ```graph.update``` method will apply SPARQL update statements

>* Several RDF 1.1 features are available:
>  * A new ```DataSet``` class
>  * ```XMLLiteral``` and ```HTMLLiterals```
>  * ```BNode``` (de)skolemization is supported through ```BNode.skolemize```,
>    ```URIRef.de_skolemize```, ```Graph.skolemize``` and ```Graph.de_skolemize```

>* Handled of Literal equality was split into lexical comparison
>  (for normal ```==``` operator) and value space (using new ```Node.eq```
>  methods). This introduces some slight backwards incomaptible
>  changes, but was necessary, as the old version had
>  inconsisten hash and equality methods that could lead the
>  literals not working correctly in dicts/sets.
>  The new way is more in line with how SPARQL 1.1 works.
>  For the full details, see:

>  https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/wiki/Literal-reworking

>* Iterating over ```QueryResults``` will generate ```ResultRow``` objects,
>  these allow access to variable bindings as attributes or as a
>  dict. I.e.

>  ```py
>  for row in graph.query(&#39;select ... &#39;) :
>     print row.age, row[&quot;name&quot;]
>  ```

>* &quot;Slicing&quot; of Graphs and Resources as syntactic sugar:
>  ([271](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/271))

>  ```py
>  graph[bob : FOAF.knows/FOAF.name]
>            -&gt; generator over the names of Bobs friends
>  ```

>* The ```SPARQLStore``` and ```SPARQLUpdateStore``` are now included
>  in the RDFLib core

>* The documentation has been given a major overhaul, and examples
>  for most features have been added.


>Minor Changes:
>--------------

>* String operations on URIRefs return new URIRefs: ([258](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/258))
>  ```py
>  &gt;&gt;&gt; URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/&#39;)+&#39;test
>  rdflib.term.URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/test&#39;)
>  ```

>* Parser/Serializer plugins are also found by mime-type, not just
>  by plugin name:  ([277](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/277))
>* ```Namespace``` is no longer a subclass of ```URIRef```
>* URIRefs and Literal language tags are validated on construction,
>  avoiding some &quot;RDF-injection&quot; issues ([266](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/266))
>* A new memory store needs much less memory when loading large
>  graphs ([268](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/268))
>* Turtle/N3 serializer now supports the base keyword correctly ([248](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/248))
>* py2exe support was fixed ([257](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/257))
>* Several bugs in the TriG serializer were fixed
>* Several bugs in the NQuads parser were fixed







### requests 2.12.1 -> 2.13.0

>### 2.13.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Features**

>- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
>  save some memory for users.

>**Miscellaneous**

>- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
>- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.



>### 2.12.5

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
>  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.



>### 2.12.4

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
>  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
>  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.



>### 2.12.3

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
>  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
>  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
>  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
>  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
>  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.



>### 2.12.2

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
>  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
>  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
>  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
>  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
>  but still common hostnames.
>- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
>  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
>- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
>  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
>- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
>- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
>  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
>  ``AttributeError``.

>### 3.0.5

>==================

>* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (`2105`_).
>  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to `mbukatov`_ for the report and
>  `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
>  and filenames, respectively (`2089`_ and `2078`_). Thanks to `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (`478`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (`687`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
>  Thanks to `dupuy`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``&quot;4 +- 4.0e-06&quot;``)
>  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
>  which can result in bugs such as `2111`_. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``±`` (for example ``4 ± 4.0e-06``).
>  Thanks `kerrick-lyft`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
>  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (`2034`_).
>  Thanks `nmundar`_ for the PR.

>* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (`2082`_).
>  Thanks `adler-j`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
>  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
>  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (`2016`_).
>  Thanks `d-b-w`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
>  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
>  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(`2103`_).
>  Thanks `jaraco`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (`2038`_). Thanks
>  `nedbat`_.

>### 4.1

>======================

>This is a new minor version RDFLib, which includes a handful of new features:

>* A TriG parser was added (we already had a serializer) - it is
>  up-to-date wrt. to the newest spec from: http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/

>* The Turtle parser was made up to date wrt. to the latest Turtle spec.

>* Many more tests have been added - RDFLib now has over 2000
>  (passing!) tests. This is mainly thanks to the NT, Turtle, TriG,
>  NQuads and SPARQL test-suites from W3C. This also included many
>  fixes to the nt and nquad parsers.

>* ```ConjunctiveGraph``` and ```Dataset``` now support directly adding/removing
>  quads with ```add/addN/remove``` methods.

>* ```rdfpipe``` command now supports datasets, and reading/writing context
>  sensitive formats.

>* Optional graph-tracking was added to the Store interface, allowing
>  empty graphs to be tracked for Datasets. The DataSet class also saw
>  a general clean-up, see: [309](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/309)

>* After long deprecation, ```BackwardCompatibleGraph``` was removed.

>Minor enhancements/bugs fixed:
>------------------------------

>* Many code samples in the documentation were fixed thanks to PuckCh

>* The new ```IOMemory``` store was optimised a bit

>* ```SPARQL(Update)Store``` has been made more generic.

>* MD5 sums were never reinitialized in ```rdflib.compare```

>* Correct default value for empty prefix in N3
>  [312](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/312)

>* Fixed tests when running in a non UTF-8 locale
>  [344](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/344)

>* Prefix in the original turtle have an impact on SPARQL query
>  resolution
>  [313](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/313)

>* Duplicate BNode IDs from N3 Parser
>  [305](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/305)

>* Use QNames for TriG graph names
>  [330](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/330)

>* \uXXXX escapes in Turtle/N3 were fixed
>  [335](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/335)

>* A way to limit the number of triples retrieved from the
>  ```SPARQLStore``` was added
>  [346](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/346)

>* Dots in localnames in Turtle
>  [345](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/345)
>  [336](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/336)

>* ```BNode``` as Graph&#39;s public ID
>  [300](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/300)

>* Introduced ordering of ```QuotedGraphs```
>  [291](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/291)



>### 4.0.1

>========================

>Following RDFLib tradition, some bugs snuck into the 4.0 release.
>This is a bug-fixing release:

>* the new URI validation caused lots of problems, but is
>  nescessary to avoid &#39;&#39;RDF injection&#39;&#39; vulnerabilities. In the
>  spirit of &#39;&#39;be liberal in what you accept, but conservative in
>  what you produce&quot;, we moved validation to serialisation time.

>* the   ```rdflib.tools```   package    was   missing   from   the
>  ```setup.py```  script, and  was therefore  not included  in the
>  PYPI tarballs.

>* RDF parser choked on empty namespace URI
>  [288](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/288)

>* Parsing from ```sys.stdin``` was broken
>  [285](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/285)

>* The new IO store had problems with concurrent modifications if
>  several graphs used the same store
>  [286](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/286)

>* Moved HTML5Lib dependency to the recently released 1.0b1 which
>  support python3



>### 4.0

>======================

>This release includes several major changes:

>* The new SPARQL 1.1 engine (rdflib-sparql) has been included in
>  the core distribution. SPARQL 1.1 queries and updates should
>  work out of the box.

>  * SPARQL paths are exposed as operators on ```URIRefs```, these can
>    then be be used with graph.triples and friends:

>    ```py
>     List names of friends of Bob:
>    g.triples(( bob, FOAF.knows/FOAF.name , None ))

>     All super-classes:
>    g.triples(( cls, RDFS.subClassOf * &#39;+&#39;, None ))
>    ```

>      * a new ```graph.update``` method will apply SPARQL update statements

>* Several RDF 1.1 features are available:
>  * A new ```DataSet``` class
>  * ```XMLLiteral``` and ```HTMLLiterals```
>  * ```BNode``` (de)skolemization is supported through ```BNode.skolemize```,
>    ```URIRef.de_skolemize```, ```Graph.skolemize``` and ```Graph.de_skolemize```

>* Handled of Literal equality was split into lexical comparison
>  (for normal ```==``` operator) and value space (using new ```Node.eq```
>  methods). This introduces some slight backwards incomaptible
>  changes, but was necessary, as the old version had
>  inconsisten hash and equality methods that could lead the
>  literals not working correctly in dicts/sets.
>  The new way is more in line with how SPARQL 1.1 works.
>  For the full details, see:

>  https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/wiki/Literal-reworking

>* Iterating over ```QueryResults``` will generate ```ResultRow``` objects,
>  these allow access to variable bindings as attributes or as a
>  dict. I.e.

>  ```py
>  for row in graph.query(&#39;select ... &#39;) :
>     print row.age, row[&quot;name&quot;]
>  ```

>* &quot;Slicing&quot; of Graphs and Resources as syntactic sugar:
>  ([271](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/271))

>  ```py
>  graph[bob : FOAF.knows/FOAF.name]
>            -&gt; generator over the names of Bobs friends
>  ```

>* The ```SPARQLStore``` and ```SPARQLUpdateStore``` are now included
>  in the RDFLib core

>* The documentation has been given a major overhaul, and examples
>  for most features have been added.


>Minor Changes:
>--------------

>* String operations on URIRefs return new URIRefs: ([258](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/258))
>  ```py
>  &gt;&gt;&gt; URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/&#39;)+&#39;test
>  rdflib.term.URIRef(&#39;http://example.org/test&#39;)
>  ```

>* Parser/Serializer plugins are also found by mime-type, not just
>  by plugin name:  ([277](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/277))
>* ```Namespace``` is no longer a subclass of ```URIRef```
>* URIRefs and Literal language tags are validated on construction,
>  avoiding some &quot;RDF-injection&quot; issues ([266](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/266))
>* A new memory store needs much less memory when loading large
>  graphs ([268](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/268))
>* Turtle/N3 serializer now supports the base keyword correctly ([248](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/248))
>* py2exe support was fixed ([257](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/257))
>* Several bugs in the TriG serializer were fixed
>* Several bugs in the NQuads parser were fixed







### requests 2.12.1 -> 2.13.0

>### 2.13.0

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Features**

>- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
>  save some memory for users.

>**Miscellaneous**

>- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
>- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.



>### 2.12.5

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
>  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.



>### 2.12.4

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
>  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
>  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.



>### 2.12.3

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
>  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
>  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
>  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
>  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
>  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.



>### 2.12.2

>+++++++++++++++++++

>**Bugfixes**

>- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
>  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
>  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
>  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
>  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
>  but still common hostnames.
>- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
>  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
>- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
>  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
>- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
>- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
>  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
>  ``AttributeError``.

The current code never cleans up its timers or signal handlers before returning, which means that the timer will fire after the timeout interval even after the `validate` function has returned. When the task completes successfully, this is relatively harmless, since it sets a flag that essentially disarms the signal handler callback. When there's an exception, the flag is not set, which means the timer fires at an arbitrary point during the execution of the task process, and raises a `ValidationTimeout` exception, likely breaking something important.

This code cleans up the timeout and signal handler after they're no longer needed, and installs a timeout by default only when launched from as a system command.

The 'test_libraries.py` file is mostly code from the very strangely misnamed 'test_libraryblacklist.py' file, but git's rename tracking is not smart enough to notice.

The code in 'metadata/libfetcher.py' and 'metadata/update.py' can be skipped, if you prefer. It won't be run on servers, and we'll probably be changing it locally without submitting PRs immediately for a lot of runs.

@kmaglione This might not cover everything. Please let me know if I'm missing anything. Here's what it does:
- Accept the combo of ""package.json"" and ""bootstrap.js"" as jetpack addons.
- Validate the `id`, `name` and `version` fields of ""package.json""
  - Perhaps `engine` should be validated as well but I'll do that tomorrow.
- All ""package,json"" errors and ""install.rdf"" errors are treated as errors, even if both files are present.

507,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/amo-validator/pulls/194,194,Fix: Spidermonkey dropped --utf8 flag,"## Issue

Four months ago, Spidermonkey dropped the `-U` (`--utf8`) flag (see [commit 53c97](https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/commit/53c97c#L16L4876)).  
Consequently,  `amo-validator` fails when the latest Spidermonkey binary is installed, because it returns the usage string (like `js --help`) and puts ""Invalid short option: -U\n\n"" in `stderr`.
## Patch

This patch fixes the bug while remaining backwards-compatible. If backward-compatibility is not an issue, the solution can be simplified to removing `, '-U'` from [line 170](https://github.com/mozilla/amo-validator/blob/3bd2c/validator/testcases/javascript/spidermonkey.py#L107).
## Steps to reproduce
1. Get a recent Spidermonkey binary (eg. a [nightly build of jsshell](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/))
2. Run `addon-validator whatever-extension.xpi`
3. Result:

```

I can't think of an effective way to test for this. A test failure will crash the machine if the fix doesn't work. A test that the cap exists doesn't mean anything because the value is relatively arbitrary. A functional test would probably be most appropriate, but again, a failure would crash the machine.

I did test that there are no other `while` loops in the JS engine, so I don't think infinite loops will be an issue. There are no generators in the JS engine, so `for` loops won't be an issue with that either.
