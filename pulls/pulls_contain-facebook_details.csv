This PR adds a preferences panel (accessible from both the add-on panel and the `about:addons` page). Beyond adding this space for future options/prefs, I added two options to start: 

1. Allow Instagram data. This would allow IG embedded posts to load. 
2. Turn off badging on non-Facebook pages. This would not put purple circles on login buttons, etc. 

Resolved/mentioned issues: 
- #550

### TODO 

- [ ] Add editable list of ""contained"" sites (#550)
- [x] Set preference to close active tab if URL is changed to ""contained"" URL (#143) 
  - Behavior should match how this is handled on M-AC. https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers/pull/1835
- [x ] Style ""Reset to Defaults"" button 
- Use ""Settings"" every where. (No ""preferences"") 

## Testing 

TBD

## Screenshots

This PR adds a preferences panel (accessible from both the add-on panel and the `about:addons` page). Beyond adding this space for future options/prefs, I added two options to start: 

1. Allow Instagram data. This would allow IG embedded posts to load. 
2. Turn off badging on non-Facebook pages. This would not put purple circles on login buttons, etc.

- [x] Set preference to close active tab if URL is changed to ""contained"" URL (#143)

Fixes #422 
Fixes #550  

**PR To-do List**
- [x] Update onboarding panel copy/images
- [x] Add tooltip text
- [x] Fix issue where ""Add this site"" shows up on default FB URLs (from [FACEBOOK_DOMAINS](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook/blob/master/src/background.js#L7-L23)) 
- [x] Add test directions to this PR 

## Testing Steps

Use the following directions to verify this PR works as is. 

1. **Run the add-on.** _(This will open up the add-on in a temporary new browser)_

```
$ web-ext run -s src/ 
```

2. **Go to the following sites:** 

- Non-Facebook tracking site: 
  - https://duckduckgo.com/ (There should be no Facebook trackers blocked on this site) 
- Facebook domain 
  - https://facebook.com/
-  Facebook tracking site
  - https://maxxcrawford.github.io/social-implementation-examples/facebook/login/
  - https://buzzfeed.com/

3. Once on the site, verify that trackers are detected as expected. 

4. Click on the Facebook Container add-on icon within the browser chrome to trigger the panel:   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2692333/71749332-bce00400-2e3a-11ea-9019-4540b8068d19.png)

5. Attempt to add that site to the Facebook Container: 

- Non-Facebook tracking site and Facebook tracking site should be able be to added by clicking the following button:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2692333/71749368-d4b78800-2e3a-11ea-8c6d-501ed8258413.png)

Once this button is clicked, the expected action is for the tab to close and reopen the same URL **INSIDE** the Facebook Container. 

6. Once added, attempt to remove the newly added site from the Facebook Container: 
- Confirm you're in the Facebook Container
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2692333/71749446-13e5d900-2e3b-11ea-90f1-5412334c20af.png)

  - On default Facebook Container sites (like Facebook.com and Instagram.com), these sites cannot be removed. 
  - On non-default sites, it should close and reload the page **OUTSIDE** of the Facebook Container.

1. Go to CNN, click icon (See the ""trakcers-detected"" panel).
2. Open new tab, go to about:debugging, click icon and see the ""no-trackers"" panel.
3. Go back to CNN tab and click the icon - It's now forgotten (perhaps because it's done blocking reqs?) that it should show a ""trackers-detected"" panel on icon click."

## Summary

This pull-request replaces standard implemented FB elements (Login, share and like buttons) and then adds a badge to it. 

**Notes**
+ This replacement is necessary as blocking the Facebook JavaScript SDK completely hides the `.fb-login-button` div. This feature also uses the data-attributes on the div to correctly size/display the replaced element.
+ Currently, the Login page has SVGs for fallback images for retina screens. Like/Share are still using low-res PNGs. This will be updated in a later PR. 

## Testing

1. Go to CNN, click icon (See the ""trakcers-detected"" panel).
2. Open new tab, go to about:debugging, click icon and see the ""no-trackers"" panel.
3. Go back to CNN tab and click the icon - It's now forgotten (perhaps because it's done blocking reqs?) that it should show a ""trackers-detected"" panel on icon click."

This pull-request adds an overlay to all Facebook-specific on-page assets. It targets them in a few ways: 

+ Any element that has the a class of `FacebookConnectButton`
+ Any `href` attribute that contains `facebook`
+ Any `data-oauthserver` attribute that contains `facebook`
+ Any element with a `title` of `share on facebook`
+ Any element with an `aria-label` of `Facebook`

## Known Issues

+ The current method of `HREF` containing `facebook` is too broad. If you search for Facebook on Google, you can see how this doesn't match correctly. 
+ This doesn't address standard implementations of FB login. This will be addressed in a seperate pull-request.

However, I'm considering if we should *always* strip `fbclid` from all urls to cover a scenario where `fbclid` could link the uncontained context to an FB account with a link to a non-FB site.

E.g. an email notification contains a link to `https://www.example.com/?fbclid=12345` which embeds a request to `www.facebook.com`.

In that scenario, the embedded resource request from `example.com` to `facebook.com` includes the un-contained cookies and the `fbclid` value in the `Referer` header, which could effectively re-associate the un-contained cookies to the FB account.",groovecoder,71928,2018-10-23T15:59:50Z,MEMBER,True,40,1,2,Facebook Container isolates your Facebook activity from the rest of your web activity in order to prevent Facebook from tracking you outside of the Facebook website via third party cookies.,JavaScript,acdeff00dbf8f571a42db4628b4677a5f6d7e9b5,fix #178: strip fbclid from urls

* edge and pixel domains with Akamai, appspot, and others
* additional messenger domain
* additional fbsbx CDN domains


## Changes
* I've attempted to dedupe the domains, [very much like the outcome of this discussion today](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook/pull/157#issuecomment-431138717).  This include whatsapp domains.
* I have also organized the domains so that they are in more maintainable groups.  This make _this PR's diff_ harder to read, but will make things better going forward.

Look for comments, inline, about the additions

* Checks if redirect_uri is MAC assigned

Really only works if the originating URL is MAC assigned (instagram in this case).

To achieve this it was necessary to change the initialization behavior. The request handler is now always set-up and the check for MAC assignment always happens in the request handlers if it's an FACEBOOK_DOMAIN. Cookies are always cleared on initialization, regardless of MAC assignment. A side-effect is that, if just one specific domain is assigned with MAC, all other FACEBOOK_DOMAINS will still get contained from contain-facebook.

Also makes sure (by awaiting) that the Facebook container is correctly detected or created and hence should avoid that [this](https://github.com/stoically/contain-facebook/blob/1cceca2ccafc28b31dd1c5054ad717b2a5c4488b/background.js#L129-L130) happens.

606,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/contain-facebook/pulls/34,34,fix #23: detect a pre-exisitng facebook container,"If a user installed multi-account-containers, they may already have
facebook.com assigned to a container. We detect and delete that
container, so it does not conflict with this container.

Note: I think we need to do some serious UX consideration on this. As @TanviHacks mentions , a user with facebook.com already assigned to a ""Social"" container will lose that entire container, and a user (like me) with facebook.com already assigned to a ""Personal"" container will lose that entire container.

We don't have any data on how many users fall into these use-cases, but based on how frustrated MAC users have been when updates accidentally delete their containers, we may end up frustrating MANY of our existing MAC users with this implementation.

An alternative implementation is to detect users who have already assigned facebook.com to a Container, and just leave those users alone. This seems like the safest and most non-destructive move. It could be combined with information on the AMO page describing how to use MAC for similar protection from Facebook.

Basically, I'm okay to merge and ship this implementation, but I'm also very worried about having to handle the fall-out and potential fast-follow bug-fixes from it.",groovecoder,71928,2018-03-23T20:50:22Z,MEMBER,True,79,46,1,Facebook Container isolates your Facebook activity from the rest of your web activity in order to prevent Facebook from tracking you outside of the Facebook website via third party cookies.,JavaScript,641d7a8e9411963fdfc18b69f3c9ae108d80ee09,"fix #23: detect a pre-exisitng facebook container
