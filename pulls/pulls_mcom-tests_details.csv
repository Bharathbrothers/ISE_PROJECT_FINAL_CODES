The main difference is that we're checking the sign up form from the **home** page in bedrock, whereas we were testing it from the **about** page here. Other than that, we don't have a check for the privacy link in bedrock. This will ultimately be covered by a link checker, but if we feel we need a check for this in the meantime I can either leave a basic test here, or add one to bedrock that clicks the link and makes sure we get the expected page.

@alexgibson do you feel that our coverage in bedrock is good enough for us to remove these? Do we need to check the form from the **about** page? Do we need to maintain coverage for the privacy link?

On a side note, I do wonder whether it's a good thing to be testing the link destinations for home page promo's in general, given that they change so often. Also now that we're using waffle to flip promo's, it seems to make less sense. Thoughts?

This PR fixes the tests for now, but I wonder if we should really remove/update these tests. We could leave the major link tests that don't tend to change, and then just test that promo links actually have valid responses?

I'd be happy to try and work this out and submit a follow-up PR, if it makes sense to do so.

There are so many links to be tested that the test is taking too long and timing out. We could just test a subset of links, but that would mean losing coverage. This PR changes it so that each link will be tested in a separate test which should eliminate this timeout issue.

I have used a technique that was proposed by @davehunt in a pull request against qmo-tests [1]. This is not identical to Dave's code, as it is not generic and is specific to just these language link tests, but if we like it in this case we could consider using it for other link-checking tests as well.

The test checks all 250+ download links on the page and generates a collective message for all links that fail the 302 check.  My decision to _not_ to parameterize is based on: 
a) checking a single link is a very very short task relative to overall test setup & execution, 
b) the large number of links checked, 
c) if there were massive number of failures it might more helpful if they were gathered in one test failure instead generating a massive number of failures.  

When links fail the 302 the assertion error will look something like:
Expected status code 302.  Lang 'ar' Windows link: status 200.  Lang 'ar' OSX link: status 200.  Lang 'ar' Linux link: status 200.

The test includes disabled code to demonstrate getting links for an single language. Tests don't normally include commented code that, but I wasn't sure how best to ""document"" the method without writing another test.

I also introduced a base test object (which I had also done previously in marketplace-tests) because the code to test the footer is identical in each page's test, so there was a ton of duplication.

Changed footer links to use css rather than link text

The other issue was that the tests were passing when we weren't expecting them to. This might not be an issue, depending on what is the intention of download link test. If we want to check to see if the download link is **visible** for the respective OS the test is running from, than this commit should fix that. The test was passing with the invalid Windows/Linux CSS selectors because the OS X link was always **present** on the page and since it was returning all three values with an OR operator, it would always return true.

If the intention of the test is to check if these links are present, you would just need to change the operator on the function to AND.
