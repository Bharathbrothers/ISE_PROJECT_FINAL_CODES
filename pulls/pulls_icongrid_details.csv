2,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/icongrid/pulls/1,1,Small codes changes,"Hey,
from a basic overview of the code (I've only started to read the icongraphic.js file and the index.html one) here is some general things I think could be improved:
- |var self = this| is overused. The pull request use it only when necessary
- Variables are sometimes declared very far from where they are used. The pull request fix only a small number of those cases.
  - There is also some cases where the name you choose for your object properties look redundant to me, like the { itemTitle: ..., itemImgURL: ... } properyties of the items list. I think the prefix 'item' is not necessarly in this case. The pull request fix some of those.

Things the pull request does not changes but will probably make the code easier to maintain read.
- splits lines to 80 characters (I know this is discussable but well...I'm using vim)
- use more line spaces between blocks of code, it's free and make the code easier to read
- The same object properties are sometimes accessed multiple time, it's usually less efficient to store it into a variable once and use this variable

Some general questions:
- Why do you use Base32 against base64? This is implemented by default (throught window.btoa/window.atob) in all browser except IE and you can just add a compatibily function in icongraphic.js for IE.
- I guess using jQuery has make life easier while developping but it's kind of annoying to have to rely on it for your project to works.

I think having to include only one .js file and one .css file would be nice.

What do you think?
