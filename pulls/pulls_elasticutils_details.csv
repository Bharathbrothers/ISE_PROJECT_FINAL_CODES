This makes some pretty big changes.

1. .values_list() and .values_dict() will now **always** send the
   ""fields"" property to ES. If you don't specify any field arguments,
   then ""fields=[*]"". If you do specify fields arguments, then it'll
   be that list of fields.

2. Elasticsearch 1.0 changed the shape of what gets returned--all
   values are lists when you specify the ""fields"" property. To
   make Elasticsearch 0.90 and Elasticsearch 1.0 consistent, we
   now convert any non-list values into list values for Elasticsearch
   0.90.

Wait, wat? Prior to this commit, you'd have the following:

    # Elasticsearch 0.90
    >>> list(S().values_list())
    [(501, 'frank'), (602, 'sam')]           # values are ints and strings

    >>> list(S().values_list('id', 'name'))
    [(501, 'frank'), (602, 'sam')]           # values are ints and strings

    # Elasticsearch 1.0
    >>> list(S().values_list())
    [(501, 'frank'), (602, 'sam')]           # values are ints and strings

    >>> list(S().values_list('id', 'name'))
    [([501], ['frank']), ([602], ['sam'])]   # values are all lists

After this change, we have this (assuming id and name fields are stored):

    # Elasticsearch 0.90
    >>> list(S().values_list())
    [([501], ['frank']), ([602], ['sam'])]

    >>> list(S().values_list('id'))
    [([501], ['frank']), ([602], ['sam'])]

    # Elasticsearch 1.0
    >>> list(S().values_list())
    [([501], ['frank']), ([602], ['sam'])]

    >>> list(S().values_list('id'))
    [([501], ['frank']), ([602], ['sam'])]

If you plan to call .values_list() and .values_dict() with no arguments,
you must add ""store: True"" to your mappings for the fields you want to
get back."

Further, it adds documentation for it to the api.

In the process of doing that, I nixed a bunch of skip_tests stuff. If
someone doesn't want it to run tests, they should wrap the class on

From some debugging I believe this is because of the way that `self._results_cache` is being evaluated here: https://github.com/mozilla/elasticutils/blob/master/elasticutils/__init__.py#L1450. In cases with no results, the `__len__` method is being being evaluated to 0 which makes this statement falsey (and triggers another request).

This will simply explicitly check if the `self._results_cache` is not `None`.

A bunch of tests would occasionally fail because the filter and query
portions of the Elasticsearch query are generated from dicts which
get turned into lists and thus we don't know what order they come in.
Thus two equivalent lists could be in different orders, but we consider
them ""the same"" because we don't really care about the order. Hence our
new compare function: ""eqish_"".

The other way to solve this is to use ordered dicts which keep things in
the order you add them. At some point, it might make sense to change it
but for now I'll just deal with this in the tests."

tl;dr: This is a big rewrite with huge API-breaking changes.

This replaces the old model-type system with the new MappingType
system. This adds a degree of separation between models (traditionally
stored in a db) and documents (stored in ElasticSearch).

Untyped S works just like in v0.4 with the exception that if you
don't specify values_dict or values_list, you now get back a list
of DefaultMappingType which are slightly more useful than dicts.

You can now create an S typed by a MappingType which makes it easier
to specify the index and doctype, but also allows you to tie
business logic to search results and also tie that back to db
objects in a lazy-loading way. For example, say you had a description
field and wanted to have a truncated version of it::

    class MyMappingType(MappingType):
        def description_truncated(self):
            return self.description[:100]

    res = list(S(MyMappingType).query(description__text='stormy night'))[0]

    print res.description_truncated()

Also, inextricably linked with this commit is a minor rewrite of the
test suite. They should run faster now, are better organized, and should
be easier to write in the future. test_django.py doesn't look like it
was written by a shrewdness of apes any more."
