<blockquote>
<h2>2.11.3</h2>
<p>This contains a fix for a speed issue with the <code>urlize</code> filter. <code>urlize</code> is likely to be called on untrusted user input. For certain inputs some of the regular expressions used to parse the text could take a very long time due to backtracking. As part of the fix, the email matching became slightly stricter. The various speedups apply to <code>urlize</code> in general, not just the specific input cases.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>Version 2.11.3</h2>
<p>Released 2021-01-31</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the speed of the <code>urlize</code> filter by reducing regex
backtracking. Email matching requires a word character at the start
of the domain part, and only word characters in the TLD. :pr:<code>1343</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 2.11.2</h2>
<p>Released 2020-04-13</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug that caused callable objects with <code>__getattr__</code>, like
:class:<code>~unittest.mock.Mock</code> to be treated as a
:func:<code>contextfunction</code>. :issue:<code>1145</code></li>
<li>Update <code>wordcount</code> filter to trigger :class:<code>Undefined</code> methods
by wrapping the input in :func:<code>soft_str</code>. :pr:<code>1160</code></li>
<li>Fix a hang when displaying tracebacks on Python 32-bit.
:issue:<code>1162</code></li>
<li>Showing an undefined error for an object that raises
<code>AttributeError</code> on access doesn't cause a recursion error.
:issue:<code>1177</code></li>
<li>Revert changes to :class:<code>~loaders.PackageLoader</code> from 2.10 which
removed the dependency on setuptools and pkg_resources, and added
limited support for namespace packages. The changes caused issues
when using Pytest. Due to the difficulty in supporting Python 2 and
:pep:<code>451</code> simultaneously, the changes are reverted until 3.0.
:pr:<code>1182</code></li>
<li>Fix line numbers in error messages when newlines are stripped.
:pr:<code>1178</code></li>
<li>The special <code>namespace()</code> assignment object in templates works in
async environments. :issue:<code>1180</code></li>
<li>Fix whitespace being removed before tags in the middle of lines when
<code>lstrip_blocks</code> is enabled. :issue:<code>1138</code></li>
<li>:class:<code>~nativetypes.NativeEnvironment</code> doesn't evaluate
intermediate strings during rendering. This prevents early
evaluation which could change the value of an expression.
:issue:<code>1186</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 2.11.1</h2>
<p>Released 2020-01-30</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug that prevented looking up a key after an attribute
(<code>{{ data.items[1:] }}</code>) in an async template. :issue:<code>1141</code></li>

<p>3.3.2 - 2021-02-07</p>
<pre><code>
* **SECURITY ISSUE:** Fixed a bug where certain sequences of ``update()`` calls
  when symmetrically encrypting very large payloads (&gt;2GB) could result in an
  integer overflow, leading to buffer overflows. *CVE-2020-36242* **Update:**
  This fix is a workaround for *CVE-2021-23840* in OpenSSL, fixed in OpenSSL
  1.1.1j.
<p>.. _v3-3-1:</p>
<p>3.3.1 - 2020-12-09
</code></pre></p>
<ul>
<li>Re-added a legacy symbol causing problems for older <code>pyOpenSSL</code> users.</li>
</ul>
<p>.. _v3-3:</p>
<p>3.3 - 2020-12-08</p>
<pre><code>
* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Support for Python 3.5 has been removed due to
  low usage and maintenance burden.
* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** The
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.GCM` and
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.AESGCM` now require
  64-bit to 1024-bit (8 byte to 128 byte) initialization vectors. This change
  is to conform with an upcoming OpenSSL release that will no longer support
  sizes outside this window.
* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** When deserializing asymmetric keys we now
  raise ``ValueError`` rather than ``UnsupportedAlgorithm`` when an
  unsupported cipher is used. This change is to conform with an upcoming
  OpenSSL release that will no longer distinguish between error types.
* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** We no longer allow loading of finite field
  Diffie-Hellman parameters of less than 512 bits in length. This change is to
  conform with an upcoming OpenSSL release that no longer supports smaller
  sizes. These keys were already wildly insecure and should not have been used
  in any application outside of testing.
* Updated Windows, macOS, and ``manylinux`` wheels to be compiled with
  OpenSSL 1.1.1i.
* Python 2 support is deprecated in ``cryptography``. This is the last release
  that will support Python 2.
* Added the
  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.RSAPublicKey.recover_data_from_signature`
  function to
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.RSAPublicKey`
  for recovering the signed data from an RSA signature.
<p>.. _v3-2-1:</p>

<p>3.2 - 2020-10-25</p>
<pre><code>
* **SECURITY ISSUE:** Attempted to make RSA PKCS#1v1.5 decryption more constant
  time, to protect against Bleichenbacher vulnerabilities. Due to limitations
  imposed by our API, we cannot completely mitigate this vulnerability and a
  future release will contain a new API which is designed to be resilient to
  these for contexts where it is required. Credit to **Hubert Kario** for
  reporting the issue. *CVE-2020-25659*
* Support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 has been removed. Users on older version of OpenSSL
  will need to upgrade.
* Added basic support for PKCS7 signing (including SMIME) via
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.PKCS7SignatureBuilder`.
<p>.. _v3-1-1:</p>
<p>3.1.1 - 2020-09-22
</code></pre></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Windows, macOS, and <code>manylinux</code> wheels to be compiled with
OpenSSL 1.1.1h.</li>
</ul>
<p>.. _v3-1:</p>
<p>3.1 - 2020-08-26</p>
<pre><code>
* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Removed support for ``idna`` based
  :term:`U-label` parsing in various X.509 classes. This support was originally
  deprecated in version 2.1 and moved to an extra in 2.5.
* Deprecated OpenSSL 1.0.2 support. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is no longer supported by
  the OpenSSL project. The next version of ``cryptography`` will drop support
  for it.
* Deprecated support for Python 3.5. This version sees very little use and will
  be removed in the next release.
* ``backend`` arguments to functions are no longer required and the
  default backend will automatically be selected if no ``backend`` is provided.
* Added initial support for parsing certificates from PKCS7 files with
  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`
  and
  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`
  .
* Calling ``update`` or ``update_into`` on
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext` with ``data``
  longer than 2\ :sup:`31` bytes no longer raises an ``OverflowError``. This
  also resolves the same issue in :doc:`/fernet`.

> Version 0.15.3
> --------------
> 
> Released 2019-05-14
> 
> -   Properly handle multi-line header folding in development server in
>     Python 2.7. (:issue:`1080`)
> -   Restore the ``response`` argument to :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized`.
>     (:pr:`1527`)
> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` doesn't add the ``WWW-Authenticate``
>     header if ``www_authenticate`` is not given. (:issue:`1516`)
> -   The default URL converter correctly encodes bytes to string rather
>     than representing them with ``b''``. (:issue:`1502`)
> -   Fix the filename format string in
>     :class:`~middleware.profiler.ProfilerMiddleware` to correctly handle
>     float values. (:issue:`1511`)
> -   Update :class:`~middleware.lint.LintMiddleware` to work on Python 3.
>     (:issue:`1510`)
> -   The debugger detects cycles in chained exceptions and does not time
>     out in that case. (:issue:`1536`)
> -   When running the development server in Docker, the debugger security
>     pin is now unique per container.
> 
> 
> Version 0.15.2
> --------------
> 
> Released 2019-04-02
> 
> -   ``Rule`` code generation uses a filename that coverage will ignore.
>     The previous value, ""generated"", was causing coverage to fail.
>     (:issue:`1487`)
> -   The test client removes the cookie header if there are no persisted
>     cookies. This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies
>     from the original request were used for redirects, causing functions
>     such as logout to fail. (:issue:`1491`)
> -   The test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to
>     prevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.
>     (:issue:`1498`)
> -   The ``""werkzeug""`` logger only adds a handler if there is no handler
>     configured for its level in the logging chain. This avoids double
>     logging if other code configures logging first. (:issue:`1492`)
> 
> 
> Version 0.15.1
> --------------
> 
> Released 2019-03-21
> 
> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` takes ``description`` as the first

As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.
