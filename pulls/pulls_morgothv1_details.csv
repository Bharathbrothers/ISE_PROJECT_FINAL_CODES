I just did the bare minimum to get the existing ""Sync"" button to work in React for local testing purposes, I did not attempt to move it from its current location so that still needs to be done.

After discussion with @mozbhearsum in IRC earlier:

* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1315801 for filtering rules by product name on the Balrog side
* consider using a field other than `comment` for Morgoth metadata - @mozbhearsum suggested that `alias` might be workable

We also discussed whether removing all Morgoth-created rules was the right thing to do - I agree that it's not ideal, but for an MVP it's reasonable.

Once we have Balrog reading and sync diff sorted out I think it'll be easy to fix it so that we only remove and modify releases+rules where needed.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of node-sass.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

[GitHub Release](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/releases/tag/v3.9.3)

<h2>Fix filename issues <g-emoji alias=""ambulance"" fallback-src=""https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f691.png"">🚑</g-emoji>
</h2>


<p>In v3.9.0 we began publishing our test suite to npm as part of our release. We did this be compliant with the node-citgm project. Being the citgm would give us early warning of changes in Node that would break Node Sass for users. We'd hoped this would allows to address these issue early and avoid the dozens of bug reports we receive.</p>


<p>However some users have experience issues with some test filenames include unicode characters. Some npm@2 users have also experienced issues with our path names being too long.</p>


<p>As a result we're temporarily reverting the addition of our test suite until we have a solution for these issues.</p>


<h2>We're sorry <g-emoji alias=""sparkling_heart"" fallback-src=""https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f496.png"">💖</g-emoji>
</h2>


<p>Noone ever wants to break someone's build. We had expected this minor change to be innocuous. </p>


<p>Unfortunately we had not accounted for the variety of operating environments our +2M monthly downloads would be running on.  Although the number of affected users was small, the failure was at times catastrophic.</p>


<p>Having this feature is important to us, but not breaking your builds, and workflows is critical.</p>

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of redux-form.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of sass-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

81,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/morgothv1/pulls/17,17,Update all dependencies 🌴,"Hello lovely humans,

**welcome to automated dependency management with [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io)**.
To take full advantage of this service I recommend to start out with up-to-date dependencies.

I just **updated all the dependencies in the `package.json`** file in one go.
Please look into these changes and make sure your project still works with them applied.
If you can’t update everything right now that’s fine as well.
We’ll get there over time.

Now that you told me to monitor this project **I’ll create a branch for every dependency update**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version. Using the results of these tests I’ll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

``` diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

In the above example you can see an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When there is a failure reported for the update I’ll create a pull request so you know about the problem immediately. When it reports success I’ll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.

This way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you’ll get to know of potential problems immediately :sparkles:

``` diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example the new version `4.0.0` is not included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request right away.

Now **you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand** – I’ll just let you know automatically.
And the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update. In case it passes your decent test suite that’s a strong reason to merge right away :shipit:

Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and of course you may always [ask my humans](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project and see you soon :sparkles:
