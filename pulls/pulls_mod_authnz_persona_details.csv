3,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mod_authnz_persona/pulls/26,26,set custom error response content for 401/403 errors,"So the approach here is that, in our `Auth_persona_check_cookie` function, which is registered as a `check_user_id` hook, if the user has a correct cookie and let in (aka is authenticated), we set a custom error response for 401 or 403 errors. These override any custom `ErrorDocument`s the user has set up, but I think it's still a pretty big net win, since this will subsequently show a nice Persona error page with a custom error message for any failed authorization (e.g. `Require persona-idp`, but also `Require user` even if we stop handling it ourselves).

@lloyd r? @gene1wood want to test this?

Since the HMAC code has no other ties to APR than that it uses the APR implementation of SHA1, I'm not sure why it makes sense to name it with APRX everywhere here, since it'll just be maintained in this codebase.
