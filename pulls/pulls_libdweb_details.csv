This PR fixes this issue by implementing both `TCPSocket` and `UDPSocket` APIs in the parent process. The API exposed by the child to the extension has not changed, but now everything is shipped up to the parent, which then pushes data back to the child.

 * The original test suite is passing as-is, but there may be untested regressions I have overlooked. I'm not 100% that the error handling behaves as before.

As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

23,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/libdweb/pulls/77,77,Fixes for browser.FileSystem createDirectory and removeDirectory,"This PR fixes a couple of issues with the `browser.FileSystem` API:
 * Add `CreateDirOptions` definition to the API schema. This was missing, so `createDirectory` would throw an error when it was called.
 * When calling `createDirectory` without the `options` argument, `null` was passed to the underlying `makeDir` call. This would then throw `Error: options is null`. Setting `options` to `undefined` if it is falsy fixes this.
 * Add `RemoveDirOptions` defintion to the API schema which was missing for `removeDirectory`
