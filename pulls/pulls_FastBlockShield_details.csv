0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/FastBlockShield/pulls/138,138,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #137


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

90,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/FastBlockShield/pulls/91,91,[WIP] The big content/frame script refactor,"For stability reasons I'd like to move the content script code over into
the framescript. This also allows us to use the etld service without
making a WEE for it.

Thoughts?",johannhof,2622601,2018-08-30T13:41:28Z,MEMBER,True,261,128,8,"A user study to test FastBlock, a performance experiment in Firefox",JavaScript,e7ee8c50be781d469829462262579e6c24bbaace,"The big content/frame script refactor

This commit removes the content script and instead uses the frame script
for all page communication.

Even with the added bureaucracy of going through api.js, this simplifies
things and hopefully stabilizes the way we send this data to the main
process:

- This makes us report vital information such as eTLD and page_reloaded as
soon as possible and guarantees that we get data even if the ""load""
event was not fired.

- This should hopefully remove the uncertainties about whether our
content script had enough time to send the final unload message before
getting destroyed, since frame scripts stick around for the tab
lifetime.

- This makes us 100% certain that we always report the correct number of
trackers, since we now query them on beforeunload. I was previously
worried about race condition between onSecurityChange events and when
numTrackersFound is set.

- This enables us to easily use the eTLD service for getting the actual
eTLD now."

Test on this page to trigger types of errors: https://mozilla.github.io/FastBlockShield/
note: these errors were created by me using for example: `throw EvalError(""custom eval error"");` 
There is also tracking on the site from GA so on refresh we can see the ping.

It may also be good to test these in the wild. One site I found is: http://consle.com/instance/examples/#handle_javascript_errors for `referenceError`.


~~todo: implement security error on the testing page so I can test it~~

note: I was not certain what `num_JS_exceptions` meant, so I decided it was all the other errors that might not be the ones listed.

this commit switches us to do per-tab tracking instead of using a global attribute. It also removes the timeout entirely and only submits on navigation.

TODO is still removing the tab and sending the telemetry when the tab closes.

It would be great if you could already have a look at this and let me know what you think. I hope I could simplify a bunch of stuff but I'm also going to add a few more comments.",johannhof,2622601,2018-08-09T17:06:39Z,MEMBER,True,225,197,9,"A user study to test FastBlock, a performance experiment in Firefox",JavaScript,0eeb71db7d8eeb3ad8f4ca700563718cd247fec9,Switch to per-tab tracking.

130,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/FastBlockShield/pulls/36,36,Use etld and uuid to generate an ID per user per domain.,"fixes: #21 

We no longer send the hostname unencrypted in the telemetry ping. Now we send an encrypted string made of the hostname and a user id. 
This is also what is now stored in `browser.storage.local` - used for identifying how many times a user has refreshed a certain page.
from a webextension we can't use external libraries so I've taken the sha256 code from `http://www.webtoolkit.info/javascript_sha256.html`

note: I chose to use [`sync` storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync) vs using `local` since This could potentially be used to record a user preference to not show the message again across devices if we chose to go that route.

### to test
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`
- go to a page with trackers, such as `https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/`
- refresh the page
- observe that the etld and uuid have been encrypted and should be seen in the logs of the telemetry ping as well as the log from `addToPayload`.
