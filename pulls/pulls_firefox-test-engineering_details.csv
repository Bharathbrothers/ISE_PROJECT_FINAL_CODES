0,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/firefox-test-engineering/pulls/24,24,Add Mozilla Code of Conduct,"Fixes #23


As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

If you have any questions about this file, or Code of Conduct policies and procedures, please see [Mozilla-GitHub-Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Repository_Requirements) or email Mozilla-GitHub-Standards+CoC@mozilla.com.

1,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/firefox-test-engineering/pulls/21,21,Adjusted header markup to follow proper hierarchical structure ,"Modified header markup to follow http://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html#headings

Reason: the header tags are generated by relative hierarchy. If the highest header on a page is marked with `=======`, then that will be generated into an `h1` tag.

The top-most header on a page should always start with `####`; not doing so prevents being able to create smaller headers, e.g. `h4`, `h5`, and so on.

Also modified capitalization in some headers for consistency.",kimberlythegeek,18633586,2018-05-14T20:52:43Z,COLLABORATOR,True,181,111,21,Firefox Test Engineering,Python,ddeed6b1bc1d8b5330245c7a4038db4dc70cf0ac,"* adjusted heading markup to follow heirarchy
