This PR, which is really just this [commit](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk/commit/ccebde4b24d06014ac573888a21813b29a4a16c7) fixes the DoS attack that was merged into 4.x code, but applies it to the 3.x code. 

This seemed important specifically because [request](https://npmjs.org/request) relies on hawk@3.x and have [said they're not ready to drop node < 4 support](https://github.com/request/request/issues/2020) (which would come via hawk@4).

So this patch will offer a 3.1.x version that has the vuln fixed, which should allow request to update their dependencies.

This particular [patch](https://github.com/Snyk/vulndb/tree/3997877197b75c7e41c9eac1825040cf2246597b/data/npm/hawk/20160119) was generated for [Snyk](https://snyk.io) users, but we'd rather see users be able to do updates over patches in their remediation.

Stop clearing offset when setting storage.,"Hawk was trying to access the local offset from `localStorage` before any storage was set and therefore replaced the previous (correct) value with 0 which makes the next request fail.

Also, the local offset was added to the timestamp in milliseconds although it's in seconds resulting in failing requests even if the offset value was technically correct. I moved all the offset calculations to `hawk.utils.now` so that the division can be done at the right time.

I figured that's because hawk assumes `request` to be the native xhr object. When using browserify, a node like request object will be passed to the function. The problem is that the node equivalent function to `getResponseHeader` is called `getHeader`. I fixed that by checking which function is available.
