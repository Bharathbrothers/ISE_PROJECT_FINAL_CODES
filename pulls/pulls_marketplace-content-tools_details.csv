76,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/marketplace-content-tools/pulls/9,9,"Refactors IA to go content type -> action, rather than the inverse.","A few changes grouped together:
- The IA originally went from action -> content type. As we add more content types, that scales rather poorly, so I reversed it. The top navigation now lists content types, and the actions for each will live beneath it. Ultimately, [the IA will look like this](https://dpaste.de/sY7E).
  - I also updated the layout of the handlers to reflect this.
- There was a bit of CSS we originally stubbed out to make the MOW submission tools consumer-facing. Since that won't happen until we get real UI work, I stripped some of it out to keep the code simpler.
  - This will also make it easier to start using [CSS modules](http://glenmaddern.com/articles/css-modules).
- For readability and to be more in line with React idioms, I wrapped the return value of `render` functions of multiline components in parens, e.g. https://dpaste.de/Ht4n

Line counts make this look bigger than it is; it's mostly reindentation.
