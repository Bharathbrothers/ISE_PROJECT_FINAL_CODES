399,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/data-docs/pulls/493,493,Describe Weekday regulars v1 and All-week regulars v1,"DAU shows strong weekly seasonality. Some of this is due to users who are only present Monday-Friday (in their timezone). Weekday-only clients likely have a different usecase to all-week users: they may be on work or school computers. And post-COVID we saw a drop in weekday-only clients and an increase in all-week clients - so it’s worth tracking these separately.

“Weekday regulars v1” and “All-week regulars v1” are sub-segments of regular users v3: we do not try to classify non-regular users, because we may not have enough data points at hand to confidently classify a non-regular user as predominantly using the browser on weekdays. A broader usage threshold than “regular users v3” could have been chosen here, but nevertheless some threshold would have needed to be chosen: so for the sake of simplicity let’s just compute this for regular users v3.

Timezones: the `submission_date` of a ping does not necessarily match the local day that the browser was used. Monday in Australia starts on Sunday UTC. Therefore we should allow some flexibility around what is considered a “weekend”: for an individual client the weekend could be Friday/Saturday, Saturday/Sunday, or Sunday/Monday. Looking at [Australian/NZ clients](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/71717/source#180033), we see that there are many more weekday-only users if we allow Sunday/Monday UTC to be considered the weekend, and not many more weekday-only users if we allow Friday/Saturday UTC to be considered the weekend. For [US clients](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/71718/source#180035), the effect is reversed and shrunken.

The upshot is that we need to include Sunday/Monday UTC as “the weekend” so that we fairly represent AU/NZ weekday-only users. Including Friday/Saturday UTC as “the weekend” is less essential, but seems to add little noise to the segment so let’s just do it.

Out of the last 27 days, we can count the number of weekend days that a client was active, using the SQL snippet:

```
BIT_COUNT(
            cls.days_seen_bits & 0x0FFFFFFE & (
                ((udf.bits28_from_string('0000011000001100000110000011') << 14)
                    + udf.bits28_from_string('00000110000011')
                ) >> (8 - EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM cls.submission_date)))
        )
```

where `cls` refers to the `clients_last_seen` table. (We can add `OR` statements with copies of this snippet that add/subtract 1 from the day of week, to handle the other tizemones)

If we plot DAU for the weekday-only users (i.e. where the above snippet evaluates to 0), then we see a strongly-seasonal curve, albeit one that is nonzero on weekends because as usual we segment today’s data only on historical behaviour.

If we relax our strictness and allow one historical day of weekend use in the past 27 days, then we capture a lot more weekday use and only a little more weekend use (see weekday_only_dau vs almost_weekday_only_dau on https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/71353/source#179227). If we allow two historical days of weekend use in the past 27 days, then we capture more weekday use but [start to include substantial weekend use](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/71374/source#179277). And the complement of this segment (all-week regular users) still has a lot of weekly seasonality - so I think two days is too much.

Finally, we should decide whether to have segments both for “weekday regulars” and “all-week regulars”, or just define “weekday regulars” and let people compute “all-week regulars” as all clients who are Regular Users v3 but not a weekday regular. It’s probably going to be easier for people if we do both for them.",felixlawrence,5019234,2020-06-04T21:37:14Z,CONTRIBUTOR,True,12,0,1,A guide for Mozilla's developers and data scientists to analyze and interpret the data gathered by our data collection systems.,CSS,72ba1fd2de4db4919a3484485b3b504e268a2aaa,"Describe Weekday regulars v1 and All-week regulars v1

DAU shows strong weekly seasonality. Some of this is due to users who are only present Monday-Friday (in their timezone). Weekday-only clients likely have a different usecase to all-week users: they may be on work or school computers. And post-COVID we saw a drop in weekday-only clients and an increase in all-week clients - so it’s worth tracking these separately.

“Weekday regulars v1” and “All-week regulars v1” are sub-segments of regular users v3: we do not try to classify non-regular users, because we may not have enough data points at hand to confidently classify a non-regular user as predominantly using the browser on weekdays. A broader usage threshold than “regular users v3” could have been chosen here, but nevertheless some threshold would have needed to be chosen: so for the sake of simplicity let’s just compute this for regular users v3.

Timezones: the `submission_date` of a ping does not necessarily match the local day that the browser was used. Monday in Australia starts on Sunday UTC. Therefore we should allow some flexibility around what is considered a “weekend”: for an individual client the weekend could be Friday/Saturday, Saturday/Sunday, or Sunday/Monday. Looking at [Australian/NZ clients](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/71717/source#180033), we see that there are many more weekday-only users if we allow Sunday/Monday UTC to be considered the weekend, and not many more weekday-only users if we allow Friday/Saturday UTC to be considered the weekend. For [US clients](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/71718/source#180035), the effect is reversed and shrunken.

The upshot is that we need to include Sunday/Monday UTC as “the weekend” so that we fairly represent AU/NZ weekday-only users. Including Friday/Saturday UTC as “the weekend” is less essential, but seems to add little noise to the segment so let’s just do it.

Out of the last 27 days, we can count the number of weekend days that a client was active, using the SQL snippet:

```
BIT_COUNT(
            cls.days_seen_bits & 0x0FFFFFFE & (
                ((udf.bits28_from_string('0000011000001100000110000011') << 14)
                    + udf.bits28_from_string('00000110000011')
                ) >> (8 - EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM cls.submission_date)))
        )
```

where `cls` refers to the `clients_last_seen` table. (We can add `OR` statements with copies of this snippet that add/subtract 1 from the day of week, to handle the other tizemones)

If we plot DAU for the weekday-only users (i.e. where the above snippet evaluates to 0), then we see a strongly-seasonal curve, albeit one that is nonzero on weekends because as usual we segment today’s data only on historical behaviour.

If we relax our strictness and allow one historical day of weekend use in the past 27 days, then we capture a lot more weekday use and only a little more weekend use (see weekday_only_dau vs almost_weekday_only_dau on https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/71353/source#179227). If we allow two historical days of weekend use in the past 27 days, then we capture more weekday use but [start to include substantial weekend use](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/71374/source#179277). And the complement of this segment (all-week regular users) still has a lot of weekly seasonality - so I think two days is too much.

Finally, we should decide whether to have segments both for “weekday regulars” and “all-week regulars”, or just define “weekday regulars” and let people compute “all-week regulars” as all clients who are Regular Users v3 but not a weekday regular. It’s probably going to be easier for people if we do both for them."

482,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/data-docs/pulls/466,466,Segments v3,"We're switching from using `days_visited_5_uri_bits` to `days_seen_bits`. After ""usage regularity v2"", we discovered that there's a relatively large contingent of users who are seen (i.e. send a ping) regularly but very rarely visit 5 URIs. Many/most of them seem to be actively using the browser (active hours > 0), probably in private browsing mode (or there are telemetry bugs meaning their URIs aren't getting recorded?). This accounted for most of the DAU in `new_irregular_users_v2`(!)

So predicting 1-week retention with a usage criterion of ""had a 5 uri day"" is a sub-optimal goal for our segment definitions. I first tried switching this goal to ""predicting 1-week retention with a usage criterion of 'sent a ping'"", but this seemed too easy: retention (for one day of users) is high enough (or: the target classes were imbalanced enough) that I wasn't confident that we'd learn what we needed to learn. I set the harder task of ""predict whether the user will send a ping in 0, 1, 2, or all 3 of the following three weeks"".

Having set this as the goal, `days_seen_bits`-derived features started outperforming `days_visited_5_uri_bits` features.

But the ""divide users into three segments to maximise MI"" approach started to become less useful: the optimal definitions were [0, 4], (4, 11], (11, 27] days seen in the past 27.

The ""[0, 4]"" segment is not so useful in an experiment context, where we want to learn the effect of a feature on new (and resurrected) users, but we don't want this polluted by the effect of the feature on users who experienced the old version for their first 1-4 days and then the new feature - because this is a niche short-term effect that shouldn't play a role in our decision making. So we do really want - at least for some usecases - a segment of brand new/newly resurrected users.

MI with three segments wasn't giving us this segment, because it's a tiny fraction of DAU (~4%) and thus doesn't provide as much information as a segment closer to the optimal 1/3 of users. So I took the _class_ of feature (""x days out of the past 27"") from the MI approach, and manually set a threshold that's suboptimal for MI but should be most useful for product reasons. In the future, we may well want to add a segment akin to the ""[0, 4] days in the past 27"" - in addition to this one, not instead of it. That new segment would probably seek to contain new users that are yet to activate.

Then the question was how to get a ""regular users"" segment - ideally one where the week 1 retention for a cohort was similar to the week n to n+1 retention drop (i.e. where the curve for the segment in [this graph](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/70030/source#176415) is as smooth as possible at week 1). Amongst other quantities, I plotted a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for "">=n days seen in the past 27"" at predicting whether a user would retain for all three of the following weeks. I also plotted the precision-recall curve.

Any threshold between 12-18 seemed to be a sensible threshold for days_seen - balancing the size of the segment and the fraction of users who go on to browse in all three future weeks. In the interest of applying these quickly, I picked 14. This means that the segment contains about 61% of DAU, and the marginal users (i.e. just inside the threshold) had an 85% probability of continuing to use the browser for all three subsequent weeks.

Previously, the segments were defined with 28 days of historical data. jklukas strongly recommended we use only 27 days of history, so that the segment could be implemented as a simple performant view.

As per the internal gdoc, the best way to implement this is to make the most recent week a 6 day week and require only >=1 5 URI day for that week. It makes the segment definitions more complicated to explain, but the specific definitions are not what make these segments useful, so this is likely a net positive change.

Also I removed the definition about MAU because it looks like there will be a potentially-long running debate around it, and we don't need to block everything else on resolving that discussion."

It's based on the latest git version of mdbook, which includes relevant bug fixes. I intend to update it to a stable released version of mdbook as soon as it gets a release.

Upstreaming/changing how we do the mermaid/toc processing is tracked in #186.
