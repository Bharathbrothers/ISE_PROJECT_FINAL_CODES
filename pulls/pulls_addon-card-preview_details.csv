<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases"">bootstrap's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>v4.3.1</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Fixed an XSS vulnerability (CVE-2019-8331) in our tooltip and popover plugins by implementing a new HTML sanitizer</li>
<li>Fixed a small issue with our RFS (responsive font sizes) mixins</li>
</ul>
<h2>v4.3.0</h2>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added <code>.stretched-link</code> utility to make any anchor the size of it's nearest <code>position: relative</code> parent, perfect for entirely clickable cards!</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added <code>.text-break</code> utility for applying <code>word-break: break-word</code></li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added <code>.rounded-sm</code> and <code>.rounded-lg</code> for small and large <code>border-radius</code>.</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added <code>.modal-dialog-scrollable</code> modifier class for scrolling content <em>within</em> a modal.</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added responsive <code>.list-group-horizontal</code> modifier classes for displaying list groups as a horizontal row.</li>
<li><strong>Improved:</strong> Reduced our compiled CSS by using <code>null</code> for variables that by default inherit their values from other elements (e.g., <code>$headings-color</code> was <code>inherit</code> and is now <code>null</code> until you modifier it in your custom CSS).</li>
<li><strong>Improved:</strong> Badge focus styles now match their <code>background-color</code> like our buttons.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Silenced bad selectors in our JS plugins for the <code>href</code> HTML attribute to avoid JavaScript errors. Please try to use <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier"">valid selectors</a> or the <code>data-target</code> HTML attribute/<code>target</code> option where available.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Reverted v4.2.1's change to the breakpoint and grid container Sass maps that blocked folks from upgrading when modifying those default variables.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Restored <code>white-space: nowrap</code> to <code>.dropdown-toggle</code> (before v4.2.1 it was on all <code>.btn</code>s) so carets don't wrap to new lines.</li>
<li><strong>Deprecated:</strong> <code>img-retina</code>, <code>invisible</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>size</code> mixins are now deprecated and will be removed in v5.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href=""https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/16"">Review the project board</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>v4.2.1</h2>
<p>Bump to v4.2.1 to republish package on npm. <a href=""https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v4.2.0"">See v4.2.0 release notes</a> for changes introduced in v4.2.</p>
<h2>v4.2.0</h2>
<p>Here are the highlights of what's new and updated in v4.2.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added a new spinner loading component.</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added new toast component for displaying notifications.</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added a new iOS style switch (a modifier class to our custom checkboxes).</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added touch support in our carousel component.</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added <code>.font-weight-lighter</code> and <code>.font-weight-bolder</code> utilities.</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added <code>.text-decoration-none</code> utility class.</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added <code>.modal-xl</code> modifier class for our modals.</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added new negative margin utility classes (e.g., <code>.mb-n3</code>). These rad new classes not only allow you more control over your general spacing needs, but also allow you to create responsive grid gutters at each breakpoint.</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Validated form fields now have feedback icons on <code>:invalid</code> and <code>:valid</code> fields. Disable them with the <code>$enable-validation-icons</code> boolean Sass variable (defaults to <code>true</code>).</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Added a new versions page to our docs</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> Tooltips/Popovers work with Shadow DOM</li>
<li><strong>Updated:</strong> Redesigned the custom checkboxes and radios for more obvious states.</li>
<li><strong>Updated:</strong> <code>bootstrap-grid.css</code> now includes our <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> utilities for full control of our grid system.</li>
<li><strong>Updated:</strong> Changed auto columns (e.g., <code>.col-auto</code>) from <code>max-width: none</code> to <code>max-width: 100%</code> to prevent content from causing a column to overflow the parent.</li>
<li><strong>Updated:</strong> Improved rendering of custom selects, ranges, file input, and more.</li>
</ul>

Up next is <a href=""https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/16"">v4.3</a> with some bugfixes, a few new modifier classes and variables, and some new utilities.</p>
