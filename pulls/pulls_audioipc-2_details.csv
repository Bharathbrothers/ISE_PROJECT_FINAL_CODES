Handling this is simple on the server side, as access is sequenced to the SharedMem by the interaction with the client via IPC (copy to input, call and wait on client, copy to output).  On the client side, an extra copy for the input is required for duplex streams to preserve cubeb data_callback's API requirements.

To allow Gecko to control the SharedMem region size via a pref, the SHM_AREA_SIZE constant is removed and a per-server configurable value is used.  This value is passed to the client during SharedMem setup rather than assuming a fixed size.  SharedMem setup between server and client is now handled via a new CallbackReq/CallbackResp message.

This also addresses https://github.com/mozilla/audioipc-2/issues/68 by reducing the file descriptor passing requirement to one per message.  Framed becomes obsolete as all transports are now FramedWithPlatformHandles, so frame.rs is removed.

PlatformHandle is simplified into a owning only handle for internal use. RemoteHandle is introduced to message.rs to accurately represent the OS-specific serialized state of a remote handle.

SharedMem is simplified, removing the non-owning variant.  new() now returns a single SharedMem, with handle access via make_handle() with clearer handle ownership.

When `ServerHandler` is dropped, we call `Sink::close` primarily for the side effect of closing the underlying I/O stream.  [The docs for `Sink`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.23/futures/sink/trait.Sink.html#panics-2) state that a panic may occur if ""it is called outside the context of a future's task"", which is what's happening here.
Tokio manages the futures task executor TLS for us, and it's not clear if it's a bug or intentional that the task drop is run outside the task context here.

In either case, we can use `futures::task::is_in_task` (added in futures 0.1.27) inside our `Sink::close` impl to avoid calling `poll_complete` in the situation where it'd panic.

This is a simple fix for [BMO 1533539](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1533539), suitable for uplifting to beta (67).  While investigating this I found several cleanups that I'd like to make to the error handling, but I'll leave them for a later bug to avoid complicating the beta (67) uplift patch.
