This patch adds the uninstall signal.

We'll eventually have the addon tell the server, and the server tell the front-end, that the addon has been uninstalled, but this works for now, and makes the event API more symmetric, which is also nice.

- `check-updates` pulls our update metadata from `package.json` and will send an array of updates to the webpage.
- `update-approve` sends up an array of addons to install
- a series of events(documented in `README`) are sent from the addon to track status of addon installs.

Also have a couple extra events for further insight into the actual idea-town addon. ie: `enabled`, `installed` etc..

- At first, there should only be a link to [an addon XPI file](https://lmorchard.github.io/idea-town-addon/dist/idea-town-addon-0.0.1.xpi). Clicking on it might not work to install, since it's not signed. So you might need to download it and install it manually.

- After installing the addon and reloading the stub content, you should see a button revealed by a message from addon to web. 
- If you click the button, you should see a notification bar come up in browser chrome, triggered by a message from web to addon.

So, I think the cool thing is that we don't need an iframe wrapper. The addon can listen for messages from a whitelist of web origins and do special things for normal pages from those origins.
