28,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cubeb-rs/pulls/31,31,Adjust drop order in cubeb_api::Stream and stop stream on Drop in cubeb_core::Stream,"1. cubeb_api::Stream was dropping StreamCallbacks explicitly, then relying on Rust's implicit Drop ordering to drop the interior cubeb_core::Stream.  The cubeb_core::Stream could potentially use the StreamCallbacks before/during destruction, so we need to free these after the cubeb_core::Stream.
2. If a cubeb_core::Stream has been started and is then dropped, it's possible for a UAF to occur where the stream is destroyed but the callback is still in flight.  A stream must be stopped before destruction, so this takes the simple approach of blindly stopping any stream before calling cubeb_stream_destroy.  The major libcubeb backends all allow this, but it's not explicitly permitted by the API.  Rather than forcing the caller to track an additional ""running"" state for the stream, it seemed cleaner to change the libcubeb API to permit this.  I'll file a libcubeb bug to update the documentation.

This is intended to fix [BMO 1447097](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1447097).

A running cubeb_stream *must* be stopped before calling
cubeb_stream_destroy, otherwise it's possible for the stream callbacks to
run during and after cubeb_stream_destroy, restuling in a UAF.

It's not clear that calling cubeb_stream_stop multiple times is permitted by
the current API (although it's currently safe to do in the tier 1 backends I
checked), but I think it's cleaner to change the API than to carry an
additional piece of state in the caller to track whether the stream was ever
started."
