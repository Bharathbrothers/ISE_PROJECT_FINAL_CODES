Unfortunately, this means that any use of the method that was relying on the additional wait is likely to fail.

Ideally in this particular case, these tab menu methods would return page objects that wait for the page to be ready. We would also ideally use WebDriverWait instead of reimplementing them in the various `wait_for_` methods. Fixing these two things is not a trivial task, so for now adding these two additional waits should be enough to get the tests passing again.

Changes:
Remove a footer link that is no longer there - note that I'm still waiting to hear from @krupa about whether this change to the test is ok
Make sure that we do not try to loop through more apps per category than exist

Note that `test_opening_category_pages_from_categories_menu` might still fail as it's waiting for the stability improvement from https://github.com/mozilla/marketplace-tests/pull/711 which we should try to merge asap

Specifically, this should allow all the tests in `tests/desktop/consumer_pages/test_home_page.py` and `tests/desktop/consumer_pages/test_details_page.py` to pass.

I will put together another PR for the other failing tests.

@krupa We need to decide whether to merge these changes to the `master` branch, in which case prod will fail until this new nav is implemented on prod, or whether we need to have a new branch to use for just testing dev and stage. How long will it be before the changes make it to prod?

It seems like maybe we are checking too quickly, and jQuery is not available in the DOM yet.  This patch simply changes the logic so that we are checking if `jQuery` is defined _and_ if `jQuery.active == 0`. The first check should short-circuit the second check, so we wouldn't check if `jQuery.active == 0` unless `jQuery` is defined.

As this change was made in a number of places this should be tested via a complete run of the desktop suite.

Description of task is no good, so I've implemented tests on my own vision of it.
First I refactored a little bit categories section on home page and moved it into Regions.
I made it because this section is in use also on category page, so I thought it would be better to keep it separated from pages. Hope this decision was right.

Added category page. There is one thing. Popular section on that page quite similar to this section on home page, so maybe it's another candidate for regions. Also code itself here can be improved for at least click on see all link to return proper page object.

And added three tests. One verifies categories section on home pages by asserting length of categories section title and asserting that categories section contains 15 items (value is hardcoded). If it's required I can change or add some checks here (but I was not sure that checking against names or order of items will make test sustainable). Second one slides category forward and backward. And third one opens some hardcoded category and asserts opened category page. I need to say that because of slider it's not easy to select an arbitrary category (need to slide for some categories, even those that are displayed). I wanted to add check for locations of items using webelement.location property, but it doesn't work )
