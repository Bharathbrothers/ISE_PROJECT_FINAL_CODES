This is a proposal to enable functional tests of server emitted events. It just involves passing the bound `server.on` function to the backend tests, so that they can listen for any events of interest.

For usage, see the incoming fxa-auth-db-server PR (I'll refer to this PR from that one).

Not sure how you guys feel about it or where it lies on the hackishness spectrum, but it was the simplest thing I could think of to do what I wanted. Thoughts?

53,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fxa-auth-db-mem/pulls/1,1,fix: resetAccount should reject the promise with a `notFound` error if the account is not found.,"Updating the fxa-auth-server to use the fxa-auth-db-mem instead of the Heap DB introduced a subtle change in resetAccount. The Heap DB rejected the promise with an `unknownAccount` error if the account's uid was not found, the fxa-auth-db-mem equivalent does not.

This change checks whether an account exists, if it does not, reject the promise with a `notFound` error.
