Changes to add support for the `TypeCastExpression` ESLint babel node type, which occurs when someone does a Flow type cast. These node types are already supported by the `babel-eslint` parser so no new parser is needed.

I added tests that mirror the same functionality already included for [TypeScript](https://github.com/mozilla/eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized/pull/137/files). The Flow type cast nodes appear to behave very similarly to the TypeScript ones.

I've also tested the changes on some Flow codebases inside Stripe; the changes fixed the `Unsupported Callee` errors and didn't seem to introduce any other problems.

Changes to add support for the `TypeCastExpression` ESLint babel node type, which occurs when someone does a Flow type cast. These node types are already supported by the `babel-eslint` parser so no new parser is needed.

I added tests that mirror the same functionality already included for [TypeScript](https://github.com/mozilla/eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized/pull/137/files). The Flow type cast nodes appear to behave very similarly to the TypeScript ones.

I've also tested the changes on some Flow codebases inside Stripe; the changes fixed the `Unsupported Callee` errors and didn't seem to introduce any other problems.

As of January 1 2019, Mozilla requires that all GitHub projects include this [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the project root. The file has two parts:

1. Required Text - All text under the headings *Community Participation Guidelines and How to Report*, are required, and should not be altered.
2. Optional Text - The Project Specific Etiquette heading provides a space to speak more specifically about ways people can work effectively and inclusively together. Some examples of those can be found on the [Firefox Debugger](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) project, and [Common Voice](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (The optional part is commented out in the [raw template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and will not be visible until you modify and uncomment that part.)

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

113,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized/pulls/11,11,Update all dependencies 🌴,"Hello lovely humans,

**welcome to automated dependency management with [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io)**.
To take full advantage of this service I recommend to start out with up-to-date dependencies.

I just **updated all the dependencies in the `package.json`** file in one go.
Please look into these changes and make sure your project still works with them applied.
If you can’t update everything right now that’s fine as well.
We’ll get there over time.

Now that you told me to monitor this project **I’ll create a branch for every dependency update**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version. Using the results of these tests I’ll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

``` diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

In the above example you can see an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When there is a failure reported for the update I’ll create a pull request so you know about the problem immediately. When it reports success I’ll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.

This way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you’ll get to know of potential problems immediately :sparkles:

``` diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example the new version `4.0.0` is not included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request right away.

Now **you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand** – I’ll just let you know automatically.
And the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update. In case it passes your decent test suite that’s a strong reason to merge right away :shipit:

Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and of course you may always [ask my humans](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project and see you soon :sparkles:

:palm_tree:

Using the results of these tests I’ll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

``` diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

In the above example you can see an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When there is a failure reported for the update I’ll create a pull request so you know about the problem immediately. When it reports success I’ll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.

This way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you’ll get to know of potential problems immediately :sparkles:

``` diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example the new version `4.0.0` is not included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request right away.

Now **you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand** – I’ll just let you know automatically.
And the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update. In case it passes your decent test suite that’s a strong reason to merge right away :shipit:

Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and of course you may always [ask my humans](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project and see you soon :sparkles:

115,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized/pulls/11,11,Update all dependencies 🌴,"Hello lovely humans,

**welcome to automated dependency management with [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io)**.
To take full advantage of this service I recommend to start out with up-to-date dependencies.

I just **updated all the dependencies in the `package.json`** file in one go.
Please look into these changes and make sure your project still works with them applied.
If you can’t update everything right now that’s fine as well.
We’ll get there over time.

Now that you told me to monitor this project **I’ll create a branch for every dependency update**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version. Using the results of these tests I’ll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.
