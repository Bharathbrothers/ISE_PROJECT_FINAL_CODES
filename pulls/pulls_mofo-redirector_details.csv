<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/pytest-dev/py/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst"">py's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>1.10.0 (2020-12-12)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fix a regular expression DoS vulnerability in the py.path.svnwc SVN blame functionality (CVE-2020-29651)</li>
<li>Update vendored apipkg: 1.4 =&gt; 1.5</li>
<li>Update vendored iniconfig: 1.0.0 =&gt; 1.1.1</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.9.0 (2020-06-24)</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add type annotation stubs for the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>py.error</code></li>
<li><code>py.iniconfig</code></li>
<li><code>py.path</code> (not including SVN paths)</li>
<li><code>py.io</code></li>
<li><code>py.xml</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There are no plans to type other modules at this time.</p>
<p>The type annotations are provided in external .pyi files, not inline in the
code, and may therefore contain small errors or omissions. If you use <code>py</code>
in conjunction with a type checker, and encounter any type errors you believe
should be accepted, please report it in an issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.8.2 (2020-06-15)</h1>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, <code>py.path.local</code>s which differ only in case now have the same
Python hash value. Previously, such paths were considered equal but had
different hashes, which is not allowed and breaks the assumptions made by
dicts, sets and other users of hashes.</li>

<blockquote>
<h2>2.11.3</h2>
<p>This contains a fix for a speed issue with the <code>urlize</code> filter. <code>urlize</code> is likely to be called on untrusted user input. For certain inputs some of the regular expressions used to parse the text could take a very long time due to backtracking. As part of the fix, the email matching became slightly stricter. The various speedups apply to <code>urlize</code> in general, not just the specific input cases.</p>
