Revised from #154, fixes #144, depends on https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-db-mem/pull/39.

Improves on the previous PR in two ways:
1. Uses restify's `NotFound` event to catch all requests to unknown paths.
2. Uses the linked fx-auth-db-mem PR to test that the server emits the failure event as expected.

Any good?

4,https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fxa-auth-db-server/pulls/154,154,"fix(db): ensure that requests for bad paths are logged, fixes #144","I made some assumptions here, so I have questions:
1. I've assumed that whatever is listening for the `'failure'` event is the thing that does the actual logging. Is that correct? Which repo is listening for that event? I tried grepping in a few but didn't find anything.
2. I've not used restify before but couldn't see a better way in the docs to do what I've done in `index.js`. The identical sequential calls to `get()`, `put()`, `post()`, `delete()` and `head()` are a bit smelly, is there any way to wildcard the HTTP verb in restify?
3. There's also an assumption in the general approach I've taken, I'm not sure if it's what you guys had in mind. Obviously I extracted the code in `handleError` to a named function for re-use, but I wasn't sure if that justified extracting the `resolve` handler to a named function too. Doing so would make the async call more uniform and improve readability I reckon, but it's not called from anywhere else so perhaps it's a bit OTT. What do you think?

Not sure if we want to do all the **fxa-auth-**\* servers while we're at it.
One cool thing is that we can use [ESLint shareable configs](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) to check our rules in and easily share them between all the **mozilla/fxa-**\* repos. I have a prototype config at https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-fxa.

You can see in the .eslintrc file below where we're extending the ""fxa/server"" rules defined in **eslint-config-fxa** module and overriding/disabling a couple rules:

``` yaml
extends: fxa/server

rules:
  handle-callback-err: 0
  semi: 0
```

You can see the base ESLint rules in https://github.com/pdehaan/eslint-config-fxa/blob/master/index.js and the ""fxa/server"" specific rules https://github.com/pdehaan/eslint-config-fxa/blob/master/server.js.

But ESLint is objectively better, more customizable, easier to create custom rules, and updates more frequently. :sparkles:
