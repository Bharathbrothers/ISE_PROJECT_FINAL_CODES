For this Study, I have selected Mozilla Organisation on Github which has more than 2200 repositories.

This Repository contains all the files related to this study:
  - It includes all the code files for scrapping the data
  - It includes all the dataset files and intermediate files generated for this study.
  - It includes a jupter notebook file which has all codes for getting the insights from the dataset generated.
  - It contains all plots for the analysis.
  - The report final pdf is uploaded here.
  - The report zip file is also uploaded here for further edits.
  - All the work is done in the VM assigned. It has all the files except the jupyter notebook.

The most challenging part of this study is to scrape the data. It took more than 2 months for me to get all the data with my approach which is still not all the repositories of Mozilla.

All the files are uploaded here. you can go through the jupyter notebook link to get more Idea about it and also the report.
